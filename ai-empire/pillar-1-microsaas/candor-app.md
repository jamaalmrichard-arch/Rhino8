# CANDOR — "Where Life is Stored"

## Origin Story
Born from two family deaths:
1. **Grandmother died** — had a will, but the lawyer didn't know she was dead. Uncle took a power of attorney copy from the lawyer and began using her life as his own — took over her identity. Family lost money and properties to fraud.
2. **Stepmother died** — 5 children (3 minors, 1 non-verbal autistic). Jamaal was left putting the pieces together. Had money and help but it was overwhelming.

Also influenced by Hurricane Katrina disaster recovery experience.

After going through this process, combined with extensive RE and financial services knowledge, Jamaal decided there needed to be an electronic storage space for critical life data.

## What It Is
A mobile app that stores a person's most critical documents and information, organized for easy retrieval — and shares it with the people they love and trust in case of emergency, death, or incapacity.

**Tagline:** "Where Life is Stored"

## Key Decision: No Server-Side Storage
After guidance, decided NOT to store data on servers. Instead:
- Use iOS/Android device security (we already trust our devices)
- Organize and store data locally so it's easy to retrieve
- Encrypted transfer between trusted parties only
- No long-term cloud storage risk
