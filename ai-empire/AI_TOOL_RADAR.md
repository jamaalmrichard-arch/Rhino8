## DECISION FRAMEWORK

Before adding any new tool, run this checklist:

1. **Does it replace something we already pay for?** -- Consolidate, don't stack.
2. **Does it have a free tier?** -- Use free until it breaks.
3. **Does it connect to GHL?** -- Integration is king.
4. **Does it generate revenue directly?** -- Tools that make money > tools that save time.
5. **Does it have an affiliate program?** -- If we recommend it, we should earn from it.
6. **Can it run without us?** -- Automation > manual. Always.
