### MONEY DECODED: The Complete Trilogy

**Everything your school, your bank, and your government never taught you about money — in three books.**

From the first gold coin in 600 BC to the Bitcoin ETFs of 2024, the MONEY DECODED trilogy traces the full story of money: where it came from, how the current system really works, and where it's all going next.

Written by J. Marque — who has closed over $250 million in real estate as a wholesaler, flipper, landlord, title company owner, and consultant — this isn't a textbook. It's a wake-up call. Three books. One mission: give you the financial knowledge the system was designed to keep from you.

**Part 1: The History of Money** — How gold became paper, and paper became promises.
**Part 2: Modern Money** — How the Fed, inflation, and fractional reserve banking are quietly draining your wealth.
**Part 3: The Future of Money** — Bitcoin, stablecoins, CBDCs, AI, and the playbook for what comes next.

If you've ever wondered why you work harder than your parents did but can't get ahead — this trilogy has the answer.

**The rules changed. Now you know. Make your move.**

### Book 1: The History of Money
**Subtitle:** How We Went from Gold to Government Promises

**Amazon Description:**

Why does everything cost more than it did 10 years ago? Why could your grandparents raise a family on one income while you can barely survive on two?

Something changed. Something fundamental. And nobody told you.

In *The History of Money*, J. Marque takes you on a 2,600-year journey through the real story of money — not the sanitized version from your economics class, but the truth about how the powerful have manipulated currency to control populations since ancient times.

You'll discover:
- Why gold was "God's money" for thousands of years — and what replaced it
- How China invented paper money in the 10th century — and the disaster that followed
- Why the Federal Reserve was designed in secret on a private island
- How FDR confiscated Americans' gold and then raised the price 69%
- The 1944 backroom deal that made the dollar the world's reserve currency
- What really happened on August 15, 1971 — the day money died

**Every chapter reveals a pattern: whoever controls the money controls the people.**

This is Part 1 of the MONEY DECODED trilogy. When you finish, you'll never look at the dollar in your pocket the same way again.

### Book 2: Modern Money
**Subtitle:** How the System Really Works (And Why Savers Are Losers)

**Amazon Description:**

Your bank pays you 0.45% interest. Inflation runs at 3-8%. **You're losing money by saving it.** And that's not a bug — it's a feature.

In *Modern Money*, J. Marque exposes the machinery behind the modern financial system — the Federal Reserve, fractional reserve banking, the petrodollar, and the inflation that's quietly stealing your purchasing power every single day.

You'll learn:
- How banks legally create money "out of thin air" every time they make a loan
- Why the Federal Reserve is neither "federal" nor has "reserves"
- How the U.S. exports its inflation to the rest of the world through the petrodollar system
- Why $1 in 1971 buys only $0.13 worth of goods today
- What the wealthy do instead of saving (and why it works)
- How Central Bank Digital Currencies could give governments total control over your spending

**The system isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed. It just wasn't designed for you.**

This is Part 2 of the MONEY DECODED trilogy. By the end, you'll understand the rules that 99% of the population never learns.

**Keywords:** financial literacy, Federal Reserve, inflation, fiat currency, fractional reserve banking, wealth inequality, financial education, money system, savers are losers

### Book 3: The Future of Money
**Subtitle:** What's Coming Next and How to Stay Ahead

**Amazon Description:**

BlackRock is buying Bitcoin. Saudi Arabia is selling oil in yuan. Central banks are hoarding gold at record levels. The U.S. national debt just passed $36 trillion.

**The rules of money are being rewritten. Again.**

In *The Future of Money*, J. Marque breaks down the forces reshaping the global financial system — and gives you the specific playbook to position yourself on the right side of the biggest wealth transfer in human history.

You'll discover:
- Why the dollar's reign as the world's reserve currency is ending — and what happens next
- How Bitcoin went from internet joke to an asset class BlackRock and Fidelity are betting billions on
- Why stablecoins now process more volume than Visa and Mastercard combined
- How Central Bank Digital Currencies could let governments control what you buy, when your money expires, and whether your account works
- The tokenization revolution that lets you own $100 of a building instead of needing $100K
- A 10-step playbook for protecting and growing your wealth in the new economy

**The old playbook — save, get a 401(k), retire at 65 — is dead.**

This is Part 3 of the MONEY DECODED trilogy. The shift is happening whether you're ready or not. This book makes sure you're ready.

**Keywords:** future of money, Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, stablecoins, CBDC, financial literacy, wealth building, DeFi, tokenization, investing, gold, silver, financial freedom
