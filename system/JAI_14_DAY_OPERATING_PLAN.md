# JAI 14-DAY OPERATING PLAN
# PARKED — NOT LIVE
# Period: Day 1 through Day 14 from activation
# Two tracks running in parallel: REVENUE + HEALTH

---

## ASSUMPTIONS (proceeding without asking)
- Revenue loop = Pipeline Mastery ($5K course). Reason: infrastructure 90% built, highest margin, fastest to first dollar vs. building from scratch. Wholesaling runs parallel but has longer close cycle.
- Budget: ~$500 available. Allocated: GHL free trial (30 days), domain (~$12), HeyGen ($29 first month). Total startup: ~$41.
- Health baseline: no current training program, diet unstructured, sleep variable. Starting from zero.
- Jamaal's best focus hours: 7-10 AM.
- All outputs PARKED until GO LIVE authorization.
