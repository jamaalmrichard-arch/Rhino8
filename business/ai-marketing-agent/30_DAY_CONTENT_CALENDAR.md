| **IG Story** | Poll (3 frames) | Frame 1: "Did your school teach you why a dollar loses value every year?" YES/NO. Frame 2: "87% of the dollar's purchasing power has disappeared since 1971. That's not inflation -- that's a system." Frame 3: "I wrote a free book about it. Link in bio." |
| **X** | Single tweet | "$1 in 1971 = $0.13 today. Your grandparents bought a house on one income. You can barely pay rent on two. The dollar didn't just 'lose value.' The rules changed. And nobody told you." |
| **LinkedIn** | Post | "I've closed $250M+ in real estate. The number one thing I've learned isn't about properties -- it's about money itself. A dollar in 1971 had the purchasing power of $7.69 today. That's not inflation as a natural force. That's a policy choice made on August 15, 1971, when Nixon severed the dollar from gold. Understanding HOW money works is the foundation of every financial decision. I wrote a free trilogy about it. Book 1 is free. Link in comments." |

| Platform | Type | Content |
|----------|------|---------|
| **LinkedIn** | Thought leadership | "Your savings account pays 0.45%. Inflation runs at 3-5%. Every year you 'save,' you lose purchasing power. That's not a bug. It's a feature. Banks take your deposit, lend it at 7%, and pay you almost nothing. The spread is their profit. Your loss. The wealthy don't save money. They deploy capital into assets that OUTPACE inflation -- real estate, businesses, hard assets. The first step to changing your financial trajectory is understanding the machine you're operating inside of. Free resource in comments." |

| **X** | Thread (6 tweets) | "1/ Your savings account is making you poorer. Here's the math no bank will show you: 2/ Average savings rate: 0.45%. Average inflation: 3-5%. That means your money loses 2.5-4.5% of its buying power EVERY YEAR. 3/ Put $10,000 in savings in 2021. By 2026, that $10K buys about $8,500 worth of goods. The number didn't change. The purchasing power did. 4/ Meanwhile, the bank took your deposit, lent it out at 6-7% interest, and kept the spread. You funded their profits. 5/ This is why wealthy people don't 'save.' They buy assets -- real estate, businesses, commodities -- that produce income AND appreciate faster than inflation. 6/ I broke down the entire system in a free book. History of money, how the Fed works, and what comes next. Link below." |

That deal -- the petrodollar agreement -- is the REAL reason the dollar is the world's reserve currency. Not because the dollar is 'strong.' Because every country that buys oil has to buy dollars first. That's forced demand. And it's why the U.S. can run $36 trillion in debt without (yet) collapsing. But Saudi Arabia just started accepting yuan. What happens when forced demand disappears? Link in comments." |

You buy rental properties, earn cash flow, and it grows tax-free or tax-deferred. I've helped people roll their 401(k) into an SDIRA and deploy it into cash-flowing real estate. The returns aren't even close to what a target-date fund delivers. If you have retirement money sitting in the market doing 6-8% while real estate can do 15-25%, the math speaks for itself.
