# CONTENT ENGINE -- J. Marque / Money Decoded

## THE CONTENT REPURPOSING SYSTEM

### Core Principle
One idea becomes 15+ pieces of content. Never create from scratch when you can repurpose from a proven source. The Money Decoded trilogy alone contains enough material for 6+ months of daily content across every platform.

## THE CONTENT PYRAMID

                   Blog / YouTube

### The 1-to-15 Workflow

Starting with ONE core idea (example: "Why the dollar lost 87% of its value since 1971"):

| # | Content Piece | Platform | Time to Create |
|---|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Blog article (2,000 words) | Website/SEO | Source material |
| 2 | YouTube video (10 min) | YouTube | Scripted from blog |
| 3 | LinkedIn thought-leadership post | LinkedIn | 300-word excerpt |
| 4 | Instagram carousel (10 slides) | Instagram | Key stats + visuals |
| 5 | TikTok video #1 (the hook fact) | TikTok | 30-sec clip |
| 6 | TikTok video #2 (the deeper story) | TikTok | 45-sec clip |
| 7 | Instagram Reel (same as TikTok #1) | Instagram | Cross-post |
| 8 | YouTube Short (same as TikTok #2) | YouTube | Cross-post |
| 9 | X/Twitter thread (8 tweets) | X | Key points from blog |
| 10 | Single tweet (hot take) | X | Best one-liner from thread |
| 11 | Quote card graphic | IG + X + FB | Best line from blog |
| 12 | Email newsletter | Email list | Blog summary + CTA |
| 13 | Facebook post | Facebook | LinkedIn post adapted |
| 14 | IG Story sequence (3-5 frames) | Instagram | Poll + fact + CTA |
| 15 | Pinterest infographic | Pinterest | Carousel repurposed |
| 16 | Podcast talking point | Future podcast | Blog as outline |

## CONTENT TEMPLATES

---

### TEMPLATE 1: TikTok / Reel / Short Script
**Format:** Hook --> Story --> CTA | Under 60 seconds

```
---
PLATFORM: TikTok / IG Reel / YouTube Short
CONTENT PILLAR: [1-7]
TOPIC: [specific topic]
TARGET LENGTH: [15 / 30 / 45 / 60] seconds
---

[HOOK -- first 2 seconds, on screen immediately]
"[Shocking fact / provocative question / pattern interrupt]"

[BODY -- 15-45 seconds]
"[Story or explanation. Use specific numbers. Keep sentences short.
Break complex ideas into 2-3 simple points.
Use contrast: what people THINK vs what's TRUE.]"

[CTA -- final 5 seconds]
"[Drive to free book / follow / comment]"
"[Example: 'I wrote a free book that explains the full story. Link in bio.']"
"[Example: 'Follow for more. This is Part 1.']"
"[Example: 'Did you know this? Comment below.']"

---
CAPTION: [2-3 sentences reinforcing the point + hashtags]
HASHTAGS: #MoneyDecoded #FinancialLiteracy + [3-5 relevant]
SOUND: [Original audio / trending sound]
TEXT ON SCREEN: [Key stat or hook phrase for silent viewers]
---
```

**Rules:**
- HOOK must be in first 2 seconds. No intro, no "Hey guys," no setup.
- ONE idea per video. Not two. Not three. One.
- Speak in short declarative sentences. No compound-complex structures.
- End every script with either a question or a command.
- Captions on screen are mandatory (80%+ watch silent).

---

### TEMPLATE 2: Instagram Carousel (10 Slides)

```
---
PLATFORM: Instagram Carousel
CONTENT PILLAR: [1-7]
TOPIC: [specific topic]
VISUAL STYLE: Gold (#c8a84e) text on black (#0a0a0a) background, clean sans-serif
---

SLIDE 1 -- THE HOOK (this is your thumbnail)
[Bold statement or question. 5-10 words max. Large text.]
[Subtext: "Swipe to learn why -->"]

SLIDE 2 -- THE SETUP
[Context or common misconception. 2-3 sentences.]

SLIDE 3 -- POINT 1
[First key insight. Specific number or fact.]

SLIDE 4 -- POINT 2
[Second key insight.]

SLIDE 5 -- POINT 3
[Third key insight.]

SLIDE 6 -- POINT 4
[Fourth key insight OR a historical example.]

SLIDE 7 -- POINT 5
[Fifth key insight OR a "here's what this means for you."]

SLIDE 8 -- THE SHIFT
[Transition: "So what do you do about it?" or "Here's what the smart money is doing."]

SLIDE 9 -- THE SOLUTION
[Actionable takeaway. Specific step or framework.]

SLIDE 10 -- THE CTA
[Drive to free book. "The full story is in my free book. Link in bio."]
["The rules changed. Now you know."]

---
CAPTION: [150-300 word caption that adds context, ends with a question to drive comments]
HASHTAGS: [15-20 from Instagram hashtag list]
---
```

**Rules:**
- Slide 1 = the scroll-stopper. If it doesn't stop the thumb, nothing else matters.
- Maximum 40 words per slide. This is visual content, not an essay.
- Use contrast and hierarchy: one big idea per slide, not three small ones.
- Gold on black aesthetic. Clean. Premium. No clipart, no stock photos.

---

### TEMPLATE 3: X/Twitter Thread (5-12 Tweets)

```
---
PLATFORM: X / Twitter
CONTENT PILLAR: [1-7]
TOPIC: [specific topic]
THREAD LENGTH: [5-12] tweets
---

1/ [THE HOOK -- must stand alone as a compelling tweet. Provoke curiosity.]
[Use a shocking stat, contrarian take, or historical fact.]
[End with: "A thread:" or "Here's the story:" or similar thread opener]

2/ [CONTEXT -- set the scene. When/where/who.]

3/ [THE CORE INSIGHT #1 -- first key point with specific data]

4/ [THE CORE INSIGHT #2 -- second key point]

5/ [THE CORE INSIGHT #3 -- third key point]

6/ [THE "SO WHAT" -- why this matters TODAY]

7/ [THE PARALLEL -- connect historical event to present day]

8/ [THE TAKEAWAY -- what the reader should do with this information]

9/ [THE CTA -- soft. "I wrote a free book that covers this in depth. Link below." or "Follow for more breakdowns like this."]

---
ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:
- Self-reply with "Bookmark this thread" or "RT the first tweet to share"
- Pin the thread if it performs well
- Quote-tweet the thread 24 hours later with a different hook
---
```

**Rules:**
- Tweet 1 must work as a standalone viral tweet. If nobody clicks "Show thread," tweet 1 still delivers value.
- One idea per tweet. No cramming.
- Use line breaks within tweets for readability.
- Numbers and specific data perform 2-3x better than opinions alone.

---

### TEMPLATE 4: LinkedIn Article / Post

```
---
PLATFORM: LinkedIn
CONTENT PILLAR: [1-7]
TOPIC: [specific topic]
FORMAT: [Post (800-1,300 chars) / Article (1,500-3,000 words)]
---

[LINE 1 -- THE HOOK]
[Must provoke "see more" click. Specific fact, contrarian take, or personal experience lead.]
[Keep under 210 characters -- this is what shows before truncation.]

[LINE 2 -- blank line for visual breathing room]

[BODY -- 6-12 lines, each separated by blank line]
[Line 3: Expand on the hook with context]

[Line 4: First key insight or data point]

[Line 5: Second key insight]

[Line 6: The contrarian angle or "what most people miss"]

[Line 7: Personal credibility tie-in ("In 20 years of RE..." or "Having closed $250M+...")]

[Line 8: What this means for the reader]

[Line 9: Actionable takeaway]

[CLOSE -- 2 lines]
[Soft CTA: "Link in comments" or "DM me if you want the free resource"]
[Question to drive comments: "What's your take?" or "Agree or disagree?"]

---
HASHTAGS: [3-5 from LinkedIn list]
COMMENT: [Drop the link as first comment, not in the post body]
---
```

**Rules:**
- Line 1 is EVERYTHING. LinkedIn truncates at ~210 characters. Force the click.
- One blank line between every 1-2 sentences. Wall of text = death on LinkedIn.
- Professional but conversational. Not corporate. Not casual.
- Drop the link in the FIRST COMMENT, not in the post body (better reach).

### Monthly Content Planning Cycle

| Week | Phase | Activities |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Week 1 | **Plan** | Review analytics from prior month. Identify top-performing content. Select 4-5 core ideas for the month. Map to content pillars. |
| Week 2-3 | **Create** | Produce long-form content (blog + YouTube). Repurpose into all formats per the pyramid. Schedule across platforms. |
| Week 4 | **Optimize** | Review mid-month performance. Double down on winners. Kill underperformers. Test new hooks. |
| Ongoing | **React** | Monitor trending topics daily. Create reactive content that ties trends back to Money Decoded themes. |

### Content Source Priority

Where content ideas come from (in order of priority):

1. **Money Decoded Trilogy** -- The books contain 28,000+ words of repurposable material. Every chapter = 5-10 posts.
2. **Current Events** -- Fed announcements, inflation data, Bitcoin moves, housing market data, economic policy changes.
3. **Audience Questions** -- Comments, DMs, poll responses, email replies. The audience tells you what they want.
4. **Competitor Analysis** -- What's performing for similar creators? Adapt (don't copy) proven formats.
5. **Trending Audio/Formats** -- TikTok trends that can be adapted to financial literacy messaging.
6. **Seasonal/Calendar** -- Tax season (March-April), market crashes, election cycles, economic reports.
7. **Personal Stories** -- Military background, RE deals, lessons learned (told through J. Marque persona).
