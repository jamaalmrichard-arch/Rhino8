## THE BIG PIVOT: GoHighLevel Changes Everything

After researching how to make this completely plug-and-play, the answer is clear: **switch the CRM from Zoho to GoHighLevel (GHL).**

Here's why:

### Why GHL Over Zoho for This Product

| Feature | Zoho CRM | GoHighLevel |
|---|---|---|
| Importable template with everything pre-built | ❌ No — must manually recreate | ✅ **YES — "Snapshots" clone entire systems in 1 click** |
| Built-in dialer | ❌ No — need separate CallTools | ✅ Yes — built in |
| Built-in SMS/text | ❌ No — need separate Launch Control | ✅ Yes — built in |
| Built-in email campaigns | Separate Zoho Campaigns | ✅ Yes — built in |
| Built-in voicemail drops | ❌ No — need separate tool | ✅ Yes — built in |
| Built-in landing pages/funnels | ❌ No | ✅ Yes — built in |
| Built-in course hosting | ❌ No | ✅ Yes — built in |
| Pipeline/CRM | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Automations/workflows | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Zapier integration | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Affiliate program | 15% recurring 12mo | **40% recurring LIFETIME** |
| One-click system duplication | ❌ No | ✅ **Snapshots — the killer feature** |

**The GHL Snapshot is the entire product.** You build ONE master Pipeline Mastery GHL account with every pipeline, every automation, every email sequence, every text script, every voicemail drop, every workflow, every landing page — then you export it as a Snapshot. Students click ONE link, it imports the entire system into their GHL account in minutes. Done. They're operational.

**This eliminates 6 separate tools and makes the system truly plug-and-play.**

### What GHL Replaces

| Previously Separate Tool | Now Built Into GHL |
|---|---|
| Zoho CRM | GHL CRM + Pipeline |
| CallTools (power dialer) | GHL Power Dialer |
| Launch Control (SMS/text) | GHL SMS Campaigns |
| Zoho Campaigns (email) | GHL Email Campaigns |
| Slybroadcast (RVM) | GHL Voicemail Drops |
| Systeme.io (course hosting) | GHL Courses/Memberships |
| Zapier (some connections) | GHL native automations |

### What Still Stays Separate (and still earns affiliate income)

| Tool | Why Still Separate | Affiliate Commission |
|---|---|---|
| PropStream | Data/list building — no CRM can replace this | 30% recurring lifetime |
| Skip Tracer (BatchLeads) | Contact discovery — GHL doesn't do this | 30% recurring lifetime |
| Ballpoint Marketing | Handwritten direct mail — GHL can't write letters | 20-22% recurring lifetime |
| GoHighLevel itself | The platform your students run on | **40% recurring lifetime** |

Here's exactly what happens when someone buys Pipeline Mastery at 2:05 AM with zero human interaction:

### Step 1: They Land on the Sales Page
- Pipeline Mastery landing page (already built — v3)
