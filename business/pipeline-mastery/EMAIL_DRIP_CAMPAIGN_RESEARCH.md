## 1. SUBJECT LINE FORMULAS

### 1A. Highest-Converting Formulas by Funnel Stage

| Stage | Formula | Example | Why It Works |
|-------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Post-Lead Magnet (Awareness)** | Curiosity + Open Loop | "Here's what happened AFTER 1971..." | Creates knowledge gap; they MUST open to resolve it |
| **Post-Lead Magnet** | "You + [Action]" | "You just took the red pill on money" | Identity-based; makes them feel like they DID something |
| **Post-Lead Magnet** | Question + Pain | "Why does everything cost more than 10 years ago?" | Validates their lived experience |
| **Tripwire Stage (Consideration)** | Number + Benefit | "3 wealth rules the rich follow (that schools banned)" | Specific, scannable, promises insider knowledge |
| **Tripwire Stage** | Negative Reveal | "The savings account lie that's costing you $847/year" | Loss aversion + specific number = irresistible |
| **Tripwire Stage** | Story Hook | "My grandmother lost everything because of THIS..." | Personal narrative triggers empathy and curiosity |
| **Mid-Tier (Decision)** | Social Proof + Result | "She went from $0 to $4,200/mo passive — here's how" | Concrete transformation + relatability |
| **Mid-Tier** | Scarcity + Urgency | "Only 47 copies left at this price" | Real scarcity (not fake) drives immediate action |
| **High-Ticket (Application)** | Exclusivity + Identity | "This isn't for everyone. Is it for you?" | Flips the script — THEY qualify for YOU |
| **High-Ticket** | Direct Challenge | "If you're still trading time for money, read this" | Calls out their current situation with respect |
| **High-Ticket** | Pattern Interrupt | "I almost didn't send this email" | Breaks expected cadence; feels raw and honest |

### 1B. Power Words That Increase Open Rates (Data)

| Word/Phrase | Open Rate Impact | Source |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| "You" / "Your" | +14-20% | Experian Marketing Services |
| "[First Name]" | +26% more likely to open | American Marketing Association |
| "New" | +15% | GetResponse 2024 study |
| "Secret" | +12-18% | Benchmark Email |
| "Exclusive" | +14% | HubSpot |
| "Free" | +10% (but watch spam filters) | MailerLite 2024 |
| "Because" | +34% compliance (Cialdini) | Robert Cialdini research |
| "Imagine" | +12% | Copyhackers |
| "Mistake" | +22% (fear-based) | Sumo/AppSumo testing |
| "Proof" | +15% | Digital Marketer |
| Numbers (specific) | +20% | SuperOffice study |
| "How to" | +13% | Orbit Media |

### 1C. Subject Line Length Optimization

| Length | Open Rate | Best For | Source |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **20-40 characters** | **Highest** | Mobile-first audiences | MailerLite 2024 (2M+ campaigns) |
| 30-50 characters | High | General sweet spot | Multiple studies |
| **6-10 words** | **Peak** | "8 words is ideal" | SuperOffice |
| 44 characters | Optimal benchmark | Cross-platform | Litmus 2024 |
| 70+ characters | Declining | Gets truncated on mobile | All major studies |
| 110-140 characters | Surprising uptick (niche) | Desktop-heavy B2B audiences | GetResponse edge case |

**Rule: Keep it under 50 characters / 8 words. Mobile truncates at ~35 characters on most devices.**

### 1D. Personalization Impact on Open Rates

| Tactic | Open Rate Lift | Source |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| First name in subject | +26% more likely to open | American Marketing Association |
| First name in subject | +29-50% higher open rate | Yes Lifecycle Marketing |
| Personalized subject | 21.2% vs 14.1% non-personalized | Campaign Monitor |
| Personalized + segmented | +50% higher open, +58% click-to-open | Marketing Dive study |
| Behavioral personalization | +2-3x over name alone | Klaviyo 2024 data |

**Key insight:** First name alone helps, but CONTEXT + name is the real multiplier. "Jamaal, your FIRE plan is ready" beats "Jamaal, check this out" every time.

### 1E. Emoji Usage — The Data

| Finding | Data | Source |
|---------|------|--------|
| Open rate improvement with emoji | +56% to +73% | Litmus State of Email 2024 |
| Top campaigns use emojis | 21% more likely than bottom performers | MailerLite 2024 |
| Marketer-reported improvement | 73% say emojis help | Industry survey 2024 |
| Emoji sweet spot | 1 emoji, at start or end | Multiple A/B tests |
| Audience caveat | Works best for ages 25-44 | NetHunt 2025 analysis |

**Verdict for YOUR funnel: YES, use 1 emoji strategically.** Financial literacy + RE investing audience skews 25-55, majority male. Use emojis that signal money/growth/fire, not smiley faces.

Good emojis for your brand: (fire), (money bag), (chart), (unlock), (eyes), (target)

**Avoid:** Hearts, random objects, multiple emojis. One per subject line max.

### 1F. A/B Testing Findings from Major Platforms

| Platform | Key Finding | Impact |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Klaviyo** | Segmented campaigns | +46% higher open rates vs non-segmented |
| **MailerLite** | Shorter subject lines (20-40 chars) | Top-performing segment |
| **HubSpot** | Question-based subjects | +10% vs statements |
| **Campaign Monitor** | Personalization in subject | +26% open rate |
| **Mailchimp** | Send time optimization | +5-15% open rate when optimized |
| **ConvertKit** | Name + benefit combo | Highest open rates for creators |

**Testing protocol for your funnel:** Always A/B test subject lines with a 20% sample before sending to the remaining 80%. Test ONE variable at a time (length, personalization, emoji, power word, formula type).

## 2. EMAIL COPY PSYCHOLOGY

### 2A. Psychological Triggers Ranked for Coaching Funnels

| Trigger | Effectiveness | Best Funnel Stage | How to Deploy |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **1. Identity** | HIGHEST for high-ticket | Application stage | "You're not the type to settle for 0.45% returns" |
| **2. Social Proof** | +13% revenue increase | Mid-tier + High-ticket | Case studies, screenshots, transformation stories |
| **3. Curiosity / Open Loops** | +22% open rates | Awareness + Tripwire | "I'll show you the 3rd rule in tomorrow's email..." |
| **4. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)** | 3x conversion lift | Decision stage | "Only 12 spots in the March cohort" |
| **5. Loss Aversion** | 2x stronger than gain | Tripwire + Mid-tier | "You're losing $847/yr keeping money in savings" |
| **6. Urgency (real)** | +22% open, +36% CTR | Cart close sequences | "Price goes up at midnight" (must be TRUE) |
| **7. Scarcity (real)** | +7.6% attractiveness alone, +178% with discount | Limited offers | "47 copies left" / "12 seats" |
| **8. Aspiration** | Strong for coaching | All stages | Paint the picture: Thailand beach, laptop, passive income |
| **9. Authority** | Foundational | Welcome sequence | "$250M in RE transactions" — establishes credibility |
| **10. Reciprocity** | Builds goodwill | Post-lead magnet | Give massive value FIRST, ask later |

**For your funnel specifically:** Lead with IDENTITY and LOSS AVERSION (financial literacy audience feels the pain of not knowing). Layer SOCIAL PROOF as they move deeper. Close with SCARCITY + URGENCY on the coaching application.

### 2B. Story-Based Selling vs Direct Response

| Approach | Best For | Conversion | Feel |
|----------|----------|------------|------|
| **Story-Based (Soap Opera)** | Building relationship, trust, top of funnel | Equal ROI long-term | Customer feels GOOD about purchase |
| **Direct Response** | Closing, bottom of funnel, cart close | Higher immediate conversion | Triggers reptilian brain (fight/flight) |
| **Hybrid (Best)** | Full funnel | Highest total funnel revenue | Story builds rapport, DR closes the deal |

**Data:** Storytelling activates "neural coupling" where the reader experiences the same emotions as the writer. Direct response triggers fight-or-flight. The best funnels use story-based emails for the first 70% of the sequence and switch to direct response for the final 30% (the pitch).

**For your funnel:** Use Soap Opera Sequence (story) for Book 1 → Trilogy emails. Switch to hybrid for Workbook → Coaching. Use pure direct response for cart close and break-up emails.

### 2C. The Soap Opera Sequence (Andre Chaperon / Russell Brunson)

**Origin:** Andre Chaperon made $70,000 in one month from a 1,000-subscriber list using this method. Russell Brunson adopted it and put it in DotCom Secrets. Ryan Deiss, Perry Belcher, Frank Kern, Jeff Walker all use variations.

**Structure (5-7 emails):**

| Email | Purpose | Template |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Email 1: The Setting** | Introduce the backstory, set the scene | "I need to tell you something about money that nobody told me..." |
| **Email 2: The Drama** | Introduce conflict, raise stakes | "I was $140K in debt, the IRS was coming, and I had $500 to my name..." |
| **Email 3: The Epiphany** | The breakthrough moment | "That's when I discovered the ONE thing the wealthy do differently..." |
| **Email 4: The Transformation** | Show the result | "Within 12 months, I went from broke to owning rental properties..." |
| **Email 5: The Lesson** | Deliver the core insight | "The lesson: money is a SYSTEM. Once you understand the system..." |
| **Email 6: The Offer** | Natural bridge to the product | "I put everything I learned into this trilogy..." |
| **Email 7: The Close** | Urgency + final push | "This price won't last..." |

**Key mechanism: OPEN LOOPS.** Each email ends with a cliffhanger that makes them NEED to open the next one. Like a TV show ending on "To be continued..."

**After the Soap Opera Sequence:** Transition subscribers to "Seinfeld Emails" (daily emails about nothing in particular that still sell). This is the broadcast list. Russell Brunson: "Lead with the soap opera, then dump them onto the Seinfeld emails."

### 2D. Hook Formulas for Opening Lines

| Formula | Example | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)** | "Your savings account is bleeding money. Every day you keep it there, inflation eats another 0.02%. Here's what to do instead." | Tripwire + Mid-tier emails |
| **AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)** | "BlackRock just bought $4.7 billion in Bitcoin. (A) Here's why that matters to you. (I) Imagine being positioned before the next wave. (D) Download the playbook now. (A)" | All stages |
| **Star-Chain-Hook** | "[Star] One decision separated me from poverty and wealth. [Chain] The data shows 73% of millionaires own rental property. [Hook] Get the blueprint." | Mid-tier → High-ticket |
| **Hook-Story-Offer** | "[Hook] I almost went bankrupt in 2024. [Story] Here's exactly what happened and the system I built to recover. [Offer] I teach this system in my coaching program." | High-ticket |
| **Open Loop** | "There's a reason your grandparents could buy a house on one income and you can't on two. The answer is on page 47 of Book 2..." | Post-lead magnet |
| **Shocking Stat** | "$1 in 1971 buys $0.13 today. That's not a recession. That's a heist." | Awareness emails |
| **Direct Address** | "If you're still keeping money in a savings account, we need to talk." | All stages |

### 2E. CTA Language That Converts

| CTA | Best For | Conversion Context |
|-----|----------|-------------------|
| **"Get the trilogy for $7"** | Tripwire | Specific price removes fear; $7 = impulse zone |
| **"Download your copy"** | Free lead magnet | Low-commitment, ownership language |
| **"Show me the system"** | Mid-tier product | Curiosity + benefit-driven |
| **"Apply for the program"** | High-ticket ($5K+) | Exclusivity; THEY qualify for YOU |
| **"Book your strategy call"** | High-ticket | Action-oriented, promises personalization |
| **"Join the waitlist"** | Pre-launch | Creates FOMO, builds list |
| **"Claim your spot"** | Limited enrollment | Scarcity + ownership language |
| **"See if you qualify"** | Application funnel | Flips the frame — they want to be accepted |
| **"Start now"** | Urgency close | Simple, direct, action |
| **"Get instant access"** | Digital products | Speed promise |

**Key data:** Emails with a SINGLE CTA receive 371% more clicks than emails with multiple CTAs (Campaign Monitor). ONE button. ONE action. ONE outcome.

**For your funnel:**
- Post-Book 1: "Get the full trilogy for $7" (single CTA)
- Post-Trilogy: "Get the FIRE Workbook" or "Show me the system"
- Post-Workbook: "Apply for the program" or "See if you qualify"
- Application nurture: "Book your strategy call"

### 2F. Email Length by Funnel Stage

| Funnel Stage | Optimal Length | Word Count | Rationale |
|-------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Welcome / Post-Download** | Short | 100-200 words | Deliver the thing, build excitement, one CTA |
| **Soap Opera Emails (Story)** | Medium-Long | 300-500 words | Stories need room to breathe; open loops need setup |
| **Value Emails** | Medium | 200-400 words | Teach ONE concept, link to more |
| **Tripwire Pitch** | Short-Medium | 150-300 words | Direct, benefit-driven, clear CTA |
| **Case Study / Testimonial** | Medium | 250-400 words | Before/after story + specific numbers |
| **Mid-Tier Pitch** | Medium | 300-500 words | More objection handling needed at this price |
| **High-Ticket Application** | Medium-Long | 400-600 words | Must build case, overcome fears, qualify |
| **Cart Close / Urgency** | Short | 100-200 words | "The cart closes tonight. Here's the link." |
| **Break-Up Email** | Very Short | 75-150 words | "This is my last email about this..." |

**Rule of thumb:** The higher the price, the longer the email CAN be — but only if every sentence earns the next. Never pad.

## 3. SEQUENCE STRUCTURE & TIMING

### 3A. Optimal Number of Emails Per Sequence

| Sequence | # of Emails | Structure |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Post-Lead Magnet (Book 1 FREE)** | 5-7 emails | Soap Opera → Trilogy pitch |
| **Post-Tripwire ($7 Trilogy)** | 3-5 emails | Value + Case study → Workbook pitch |
| **Post-Mid-Tier ($97 Workbook)** | 7-10 emails | Deep value + Transformation stories → Application pitch |
| **Application Nurture** | 3-5 emails | Overcome objections → Book call |
| **Re-Engagement (Cold leads)** | 3-5 emails | Re-hook + new angle → segment or remove |
| **Cart Close (any tier)** | 3 emails over 48-72 hrs | Reminder → Scarcity → Final call |

### 3B. Best Send Times and Days (2024-2025 Data)

| Metric | Finding | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Best days for open rates** | Thursday > Friday > Wednesday | MailerLite 2025 (2M+ campaigns) |
| **Friday open rate** | 49.72% (highest) | MailerLite Dec 2024 - Nov 2025 |
| **Monday open rate** | 49.44% (close second) | MailerLite Dec 2024 - Nov 2025 |
| **Best time for OPENS** | 8 AM - 11 AM local time | Multiple studies |
| **Best time for CLICKS** | 8 PM - 9 PM local time | Omnisend 2025 |
| **8 PM send** | 59% open rate | Omnisend 2025 |
| **2 PM send** | 45% open rate | Omnisend 2025 |
| **Educational content** | Earlier in the week (Mon-Wed) | Salesforce 2024 |
| **Action-oriented emails** | Later in the week (Thu-Fri) | Salesforce 2024 |

**Recommended schedule for your funnel:**
- **Value/education emails:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 9 AM local
- **Pitch/CTA emails:** Thursday, 8 PM local (highest open + click overlap)
- **Cart close emails:** Friday 8 PM (urgency + weekend decision time)
- **Weekend:** No sends (rest the list; exception: Sunday PM for "last chance" close)

### 3C. Cadence: Daily vs Every Other Day

| Frequency | Open Rate | Unsubscribe Rate | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **Daily** | Lower per-email but higher total | Higher if no value | Soap opera sequences, launch windows, cart close |
| **Every other day** | Higher per-email | Lower | Standard nurture sequences |
| **2-3x per week** | Optimal balance | Lowest | Long-term broadcast list |
| **Weekly** | Highest per-email | Very low | Post-sequence ongoing relationship |

**Data point:** Sending more frequently (weekly+) actually results in LOWER unsubscribe rates than sending less than once per month (MailerLite 2025, 42,000 accounts). Irregular sending is worse than frequent sending.

**Recommended cadence for your funnel:**
- **Soap Opera (Post-Book 1):** Daily for 5-7 days
- **Tripwire nurture:** Every other day for 3-5 emails
- **Workbook → Coaching nurture:** Every other day for 7-10 emails (10-20 day sequence)
- **Application nurture:** Daily for 3-5 days (urgency)
- **Broadcast list (ongoing):** 2x per week (Tue + Thu)
- **Cart close:** Daily (3 emails over 48-72 hours)

### 3D. When to Introduce the Next Offer

| Transition | Introduce After | Data/Logic |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| FREE → $7 Trilogy | Email 3-5 of Soap Opera | After trust is built + identity shift has occurred |
| $7 Trilogy → $97 Workbook | Email 2-3 of post-purchase | Buyer is warm, capitalize on buyer momentum (Ryan Deiss: "buyers are 10x more likely to buy again") |
| $97 Workbook → $5,997 Coaching | Email 5-7 of nurture | Need substantial social proof and value delivery first |
| Cold lead → Re-engage | After 90 days of no activity | Win-back sequence, then new offer angle |

### 3E. The Value-to-Pitch Ratio

| Ratio | Format | Best For |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **3:1 (value:pitch)** | 3 value emails, 1 pitch | Standard nurture, building goodwill |
| **4:1** | 4 value, 1 pitch | Cold audiences, premium brands |
| **2:1** | 2 value, 1 pitch | Warm audiences, launch sequences |
| **1:1** | Value + soft pitch in each | Expert-level copy where value IS the pitch |

**Best practice for your funnel:** Start at 3:1 in the awareness stage. Move to 2:1 in consideration. Move to 1:1 in decision (every email adds value AND includes a CTA). During cart close, go pure pitch.

**The Hormozi approach:** Every email provides massive value AND includes a CTA. He never sends a "pure value" email without a path to purchase. This is the 1:1 model — but it only works when the value is genuinely excellent.

### 3F. Warm-Up Period Before High-Ticket Pitch

| Offer Price | Minimum Warm-Up | Optimal Warm-Up | Emails Before Pitch |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| $7 tripwire | 2-3 days | 3-5 days | 3-5 emails |
| $97 product | 5-7 days | 7-14 days | 5-7 emails |
| $997-$2,997 | 14-21 days | 21-30 days | 7-12 emails |
| $5,000-$15,000 | 21-30 days | 30-45 days | 10-15 emails |

**For your $5,997 coaching offer:** Minimum 21 days of nurture from the time they enter your ecosystem. Someone who downloads Book 1, buys the trilogy, buys the workbook, AND consumes content needs at least 3-4 weeks before they see the application. Don't rush it.

## 4. DESIGN & FORMATTING

### 4A. Plain Text vs HTML: The Verdict

| Format | Open Rate | Click Rate | Conversion | Best For |
|--------|-----------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Plain text** | Higher | Higher | 60% of conversions from existing customers | Coaching, consulting, personal brand |
| **HTML designed** | Lower | Lower | 49% from non-customers | E-commerce, retail, visual products |
| **Hybrid (light HTML)** | Balanced | Balanced | Best deliverability + readability | Most effective compromise |

**For your funnel: PLAIN TEXT wins.** Coaching relies on trust. A plain text email feels like a personal message from J. Marque. An HTML template feels like a newsletter from a corporation.

**Recommended approach:**
- **All Soap Opera emails:** 100% plain text
- **Value emails:** Plain text with maybe ONE image (screenshot, chart)
- **Case study emails:** Plain text with 1 embedded image (result screenshot)
- **Cart close:** Plain text (urgency feels more real in plain text)
- **Welcome email:** Light HTML (brand color header, then plain text body)

### 4B. Font, Color, Layout Best Practices

For plain text emails (your primary format):
- **Font:** System default (whatever their email client uses) — this IS the advantage of plain text
- **Link color:** Standard blue (don't override)
- **Bold/italic:** Use sparingly for emphasis. Bold the CTA link.
- **Line length:** 50-60 characters per line (optimal readability)
- **Paragraphs:** 1-3 sentences max. White space = readability.
- **Layout:** Linear. No columns. No sidebars. Top-to-bottom scroll.

For the occasional HTML email:
- **Brand color:** Use your gold/black from Money Decoded covers
- **Header:** Simple text logo or name, not a big image banner
- **Body:** Left-aligned, single column, 600px max width
- **Footer:** Unsubscribe link, physical address (CAN-SPAM), social links

### 4C. Mobile Optimization Stats

| Metric | Data | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| Emails opened on mobile | 41-60% (varies by study) | Litmus 2024 |
| Mobile-optimized CTA improvement | +32.5% conversion | Sender.net 2025 |
| Single-column layout | Required for mobile | All studies |
| Min tap target for buttons | 44x44 pixels | Apple HIG |
| Font size minimum | 14px body, 22px headline | Email on Acid |

**Non-negotiable:** Every email must be mobile-first. Since you're using plain text primarily, this is handled automatically. For any HTML emails, single column at 600px width, 14px minimum font.

### 4D. Image Usage

| Finding | Data | Source |
|---------|------|--------|
| Optimal image count | 3 or fewer per email | Constant Contact study |
| Best combination | 3 images + ~20 lines of text | Highest CTR (Constant Contact) |
| Image-heavy emails | Lower deliverability | Multiple studies |
| Alt text requirement | Always include | Accessibility + deliverability |
| Image file size | Under 200KB per image | Best practice for load time |

**For your funnel:** Most emails = 0 images (plain text). When you DO use an image:
- Case study emails: 1 screenshot of results
- Testimonial emails: 1 headshot of the client (with permission)
- Workbook pitch: 1 mockup of the product
- Never more than 2 images in any email

### 4E. Button vs Text Link CTAs

| CTA Type | Click Improvement | Source |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| **Button over text link** | +28% to +127% | Campaign Monitor / Unbounce |
| **Button over text link** | +45% boost in clicks | Unbounce |
| **Single CTA** | +371% more clicks | Campaign Monitor |
| **Mobile-optimized button** | +32.5% conversion | Various |

**Recommendation:** Even in plain text emails, you can use a "pseudo-button" — a standalone line with the link, surrounded by whitespace:

```
[Get the trilogy for $7 →]
link here
```

For HTML emails: ONE button, high contrast (gold on black or white on dark blue), full-width on mobile, centered, above the fold if possible.

## 5. HIGH-TICKET SPECIFIC TACTICS

### 5A. How Top Coaches Structure Email Sequences

#### Alex Hormozi's Approach
- **Philosophy:** Give away the secrets, sell the implementation
- **Email strategy:** Massive value in every email; every email has a CTA
- **Key insight:** Your free content should be better than competitors' paid content
- **Lead gen:** 20,000+ new leads/day across 16 industries
- **Value equation:** Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood / Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice
- **Email format:** Long-form, story-driven, data-heavy, plain text feel
- **Offer structure:** Anchor against much higher price, then present the investment

#### Sam Ovens' Approach ($20M Webinar Funnel)
- **Model:** FB/IG ads → Webinar registration → Email sequence → Strategy session → Close
- **Email sequence:**
  - Confirmation email (immediate)
  - Welcome email (1 day before webinar, from assistant)
  - 3-hour reminder
  - 1-hour reminder
  - "Starting now" email
  - Post-webinar: link back to registration (replay/re-register)
- **Key insight:** The webinar does the selling; emails just get people TO the webinar
- **Personalization:** Name on image in welcome email
- **Ad style:** Long-form lifestyle ads that paint the desired future

#### Dan Henry's Approach
- **Model:** Value-first content → Application → Phone close
- **Email style:** Direct, no fluff, results-focused
- **Key insight:** "High Ticket Selling" script — 12-phase sales script for phone
- **Funnel:** Students fill in email template blanks (not one-size-fits-all)
- **Focus:** The PHONE CALL closes, not the email — emails just get qualified applicants ON the call

#### Common Threads Across All Three:
1. Emails don't close high-ticket sales — CALLS do. Emails get people to APPLY.
2. Every email provides genuine value (not just teasers)
3. Plain text or simple formatting (personal feel)
4. Strong identity/aspirational positioning
5. Social proof in EVERY email (embedded naturally, not forced)

### 5B. Application Funnel Emails for $5K-$15K Offers

**The Application Funnel Email Framework (7 emails before application):**

| # | Email Type | Purpose | Key Element |
|---|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Welcome + Identity | "You're different from the masses" | Set the frame: they're selected, not sold to |
| 2 | Origin Story | Build authority + relatability | Your $250M in RE, military background, the struggle |
| 3 | Framework Reveal | Teach your core system | Give them the WHAT (keep the HOW for coaching) |
| 4 | Case Study #1 | Proof it works | Before/after with specific numbers |
| 5 | Common Mistakes | Position as the guide | "3 mistakes that keep smart people from building wealth" |
| 6 | Case Study #2 + FAQ | More proof + objection handling | Address "Can I afford this?" "Will this work for me?" |
| 7 | The Invitation | Application CTA | "We're accepting 12 people for the March cohort" |

### 5C. Testimonial / Case Study Email Format

**The Before-During-After (BDA) Framework:**

```
Subject: She went from $0 to $4,200/mo passive income

[First name],

Meet Sarah.

12 months ago, she was working 60 hours a week as a nurse,
saving $200/month, watching inflation eat it alive.

She downloaded Money Decoded. Then she joined the program.

Within 90 days, she:
- Closed her first wholesale deal ($8,500 assignment fee)
- Used that to fund her first BRRRR rental
- Now collects $4,200/mo in passive income from 3 doors

The difference? She stopped trying to figure it out alone
and followed a system.

Sarah isn't special. She just had the right information
and the accountability to execute.

If you're ready for the same transformation:

[Apply for the program →]

— J. Marque

P.S. Sarah's full case study (with screenshots of her
first deal) is inside the application portal.
```

**Elements that make this convert:**
1. Specific name (real person, real story)
2. Relatable starting point (nurse, 60 hours, $200 savings)
3. Specific timeline (12 months, 90 days)
4. Specific numbers ($8,500, $4,200/mo, 3 doors)
5. Bridge to the reader ("Sarah isn't special")
6. Single CTA
7. P.S. creates additional curiosity

### 5D. The "Break-Up" Email — Does It Work?

**YES. Data says break-up emails work.**

- Break-up emails leverage loss aversion (losing something feels 2x worse than gaining something)
- 70% of responses in sales sequences come from emails 2-4, but the break-up email captures the remaining holdouts
- Timing: 4-5 days after the last follow-up

**Break-Up Email Template:**

```
Subject: closing your file

[First name],

I've sent you a few emails about [the program/workbook/trilogy]
and haven't heard back.

No hard feelings — I get it. Life's busy.

But I respect your time, so this is my last email about it.

If you ever want to revisit, you know where to find me.

If not, I'll still be sending you free insights on money,
wealth, and real estate every week. No pitch, just value.

Either way — I'm rooting for you.

— J. Marque

P.S. If the timing just isn't right, reply "later" and
I'll check in with you in 90 days. No strings.
```

**Why this works:**
1. Subject line is lowercase, pattern interrupt, curiosity-driven
2. No guilt, no pressure — just honesty

### 5E. Re-Engagement Sequences for Cold Leads

**When to trigger:** 90 days of no opens/clicks

**Structure (3-5 emails over 2 weeks):**

| # | Email | Subject | Purpose |
|---|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | The Check-In | "Still interested in [topic]?" | Soft re-engagement, no pitch |
| 2 | New Value Drop | "This changed everything for me in 2026" | Give them a reason to care again |
| 3 | The Story | "[Name] just closed their first deal" | Social proof re-hook |
| 4 | The Ask | "Quick question for you" | Get a reply (engagement signal) |
| 5 | Clean Break | "Should I remove you?" | Forces decision; cleans list |

**Data:** Multi-touch re-engagement produces 10% higher conversion than new leads (Cleverly 2025). Multi-channel approach (email + LinkedIn + retargeting) delivers 2-3x better response rates.

**For cold leads who don't re-engage after 5 emails:** Remove them from the list. A clean list with high engagement > a bloated list with low engagement. Deliverability depends on it.
