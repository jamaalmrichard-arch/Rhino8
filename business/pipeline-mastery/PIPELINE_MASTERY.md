## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS
Pipeline Mastery is a $5,000 automated course + CRM system that teaches real estate agents, wholesalers, and investors how to find motivated seller leads that nobody else has — and automate the entire follow-up process.

The buyer pays $5,000 (or $156/mo via Affirm), gets instant access to 8 training modules + a GoHighLevel Snapshot that imports a complete pre-built CRM, pipeline, automations, scripts, templates, and 13-touch follow-up system in 5 minutes.

The business runs 100% anonymously. No personal name, no face, no voice. AI avatars and synthetic voices handle all content. The brand IS the product.

## SELLER PSYCHOLOGY FRAMEWORK (Soft Language)

### The 4 Pillars of Pre-Qualifying
1. CONDITION — "How would you describe the current condition of the property?"
2. TIMELINE — "Is there a particular timeline you or the family are working with?"
3. MOTIVATION — "What's prompting the decision to consider selling at this point?"
4. PRICE — "Have you had a chance to think about what you'd like to see for the property?"

### Key Word Swaps
- "sell" → "part with" or "entertain an offer on"
- "buy" → "take over" or "help with"
- "price" → "what you'd like to see" or "number that works"
- "deal" → "arrangement" or "understanding"
- "sign" → "approve" or "authorize"
- "contract" → "agreement" or "paperwork"
- "problem" → "situation" or "challenge"
- "cheap" → "workable" or "flexible"
- "I want" → "would it work if" or "how would you feel about"
- "You need to" → "One option might be"

### Core Principle: "Would you or the family be interested in entertaining an offer on the property?"
This single sentence embodies all soft language principles: inclusive (family), non-threatening (interested), non-committal (entertaining), respectful (offer on the property).

## MARKETING STRATEGY (100% ANONYMOUS)

## MARKETING AUDIENCE — CONTACT DATA

### Target Buyers
1. New RE agents (0-2 years experience) — desperate for leads
2. Solo agents — need systems, doing everything themselves
3. Agents in expensive markets (CA, NY, FL, TX metros) — higher commissions, can afford $5K
4. Wholesale-curious agents — interested in off-market deals
5. RE investors — already wholesaling or want to start

### Contact Data Sources
- RealEstateAgentData.com — 2.37M agents, ~$199-399 one-time purchase
- Apollo.io — Free tier for targeted filtering by title/location/company
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator ($99/mo) — Most granular filtering
- Organic list building — Lead magnets → email capture → highest conversion

### Cold Email Campaign (5 emails over 21 days via GHL)
1. Day 0: Value-first, introduce the follow-up problem
2. Day 3: "Muddy water vs clear stream" concept
3. Day 7: System overview, 13-touch teaser
4. Day 14: Social proof and results
5. Day 21: Hard CTA with BNPL options

## PAYMENT & DELIVERY (100% AUTOMATED)

### Payment Flow
1. Student lands on sales page (hosted on custom domain or GHL)
2. Clicks "Get Started" → Stripe checkout
3. BNPL options: Klarna (4 payments of $1,250), Affirm ($156/mo for 36mo), Afterpay, or pay in full
4. All BNPL pays seller in full immediately — financing company takes the risk
5. Stripe webhook → GHL Workflow fires

### Post-Purchase Automation (GHL Workflow)
Trigger: Stripe payment confirmed
→ Create contact in GHL
→ Tag as "Student — Active"
→ Send email: Course login + Snapshot import link + welcome video
→ Send SMS: "Your Pipeline Mastery access is ready. Check your email."
→ Enroll in onboarding email sequence (10 emails over 30 days)
→ Add to student community

### Support Architecture (Zero Calls)
Layer 1: Automated onboarding emails (10 emails, 30 days)
Layer 2: Troubleshooting Module 9 (20 screen recording videos)
Layer 3: Searchable FAQ in course portal
Layer 4: Student community (students help students)
Layer 5: Support form with self-solve gate
Layer 6: AI chatbot (future — GHL built-in, trained on FAQ)

## STUDENT STARTUP COSTS

### Minimum Viable Stack: ~$246/month
- GHL Starter: $97/mo
- PropStream: $99/mo
- GHL usage (SMS/calls/email): ~$50/mo

### Full Recommended Stack: ~$650-900/month
- Add BatchLeads: ~$50-99/mo
- Add Ballpoint Marketing: ~$300-500/mo (1 campaign)

### Sales Page Framing
"Under $250/month to start. That's less than one Zillow lead. Your first deal is $8,000-$25,000. One deal pays for the system plus 6-12 months of operating costs."

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
- Pipeline Mastery total Year 1 cost: ~$8,000 (course + tools)
- TTP by Brent Daniels: $12,000-$17,000
- REI Game Changers: $10,000-$15,000
- Our system is cheapest because GHL consolidates what competitors make you buy separately (CRM + dialer + SMS + email + voicemail + course hosting = one tool)

## EFFICIENCY RULES FOR CLAUDE
- I know RE, wholesaling, GHL, and marketing. Don't explain basics.
- Skip disclaimers. Be direct.
- When I say "write a script" — write a HeyGen-ready script with natural conversational pacing
- When I say "write an email" — write a Pipeline Mastery marketing email ready to drop into GHL
- When I say "write an SMS" — write a 160-character-max text message
- When I say "build a workflow" — describe the GHL workflow step-by-step (trigger → conditions → actions)
- When I ask about the Snapshot — reference the 13-touch system and pipeline stages above
- Default to the anonymous brand voice: authoritative, system-focused, no personal pronouns
- All content should be producible by AI avatar or screen recording — never assume I'm on camera
- Keep everything CAN-SPAM compliant (unsubscribe, physical address, honest subject lines)
