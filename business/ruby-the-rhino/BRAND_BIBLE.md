# 1. BRAND ORIGIN STORY

## Why a Rhino

The rhino is not a random mascot. It is the spine of everything Jamaal Marque Richard has built.

Scott Alexander's *Rhinoceros Success* defines the rhino as the person who charges through life with massive energy, thick skin, and singular focus. While cows graze passively and wait for things to happen, rhinos charge. They set a target, lower their horn, and go. Jamaal adopted this philosophy after the Marine Corps. It carried him through $250M+ in real estate transactions, through building and losing companies, through IRS debt and lawsuits, and through every moment he chose to keep moving forward instead of stopping.

His LLC is Gold Rhino. His GitHub repo is Rhino8. The rhino is not branding -- it is identity.

Ruby the Rhino was born from a single question: **What if somebody had taught me about money when I was Isaac's age?**

Isaac is Jamaal's nephew. Three years old. The boy who gives him hope and joy for the future. When Jamaal watches Isaac play, he sees every Black and brown child who will grow up in a system that was never designed to teach them how money works. A system that teaches compliance, not financial literacy. A system that produces workers, not owners.

Ruby the Rhino exists to change that -- one child, one family, one lesson at a time.

Ruby is not a cartoon character selling merchandise. Ruby is a movement disguised as a children's brand. She teaches kids what schools refuse to: that money is a tool, that saving is a superpower, that owning things matters more than buying things, and that every family deserves to build wealth that lasts longer than one generation.

## The Mission Statement

**Ruby the Rhino teaches kids and families that money is a tool -- and everyone deserves to know how to use it.**

## The Legacy Statement

This brand is bigger than revenue. Ruby the Rhino is how Jamaal's mission -- establishing generational wealth for OTHER families, not just his own -- reaches the generation that can still be shaped. The parents learn from J. Marque. The kids learn from Ruby. The family builds together.

# 2. CHARACTER BIBLE

## 2A. RUBY THE RHINO -- Primary Character

### Full Name
Ruby Rhinoceros (friends call her Ruby, adults call her Miss Ruby)

### Species
Indian rhinoceros (one horn -- cleaner, more iconic silhouette for children's illustration)

### Age
8 years old (relatable to the center of the 4-12 target range)

### Gender
Female

### Appearance
- **Skin color:** Warm gray with a subtle rose/mauve undertone (the "ruby" in her name -- not pink, not purple, a sophisticated warm gray that catches light with a rosy glow)
- **Horn:** Single horn, golden-colored (a nod to Gold Rhino -- the horn glows slightly when Ruby has a big idea)
- **Eyes:** Large, warm brown eyes with long lashes -- expressive, kind, curious
- **Build:** Sturdy and strong but not intimidating -- round, friendly proportions that feel huggable
- **Signature outfit:** A ruby-red messenger bag worn across her body (this is where she keeps her "Money Map" and her savings jar). She also wears a single gold bracelet on her front right ankle
- **Shoes:** Red high-top sneakers (relatable, cool, and practical -- rhinos who charge need good shoes)
- **Expression default:** Confident smile, slightly tilted head -- the look of a kid who is about to teach you something and is excited about it

### Personality Profile

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Curious** | Ruby asks "why" about everything. Why does a dollar buy less than it used to? Why do some people have big houses and others don't? Why does the piggy bank matter? Her curiosity drives every lesson. |
| **Brave** | She charges toward problems, not away from them. When something is confusing or scary (like big numbers or the word "debt"), Ruby faces it head-on. She has thick skin -- she does not let setbacks stop her. |
| **Generous** | Ruby's first instinct is to share what she learns. She does not hoard knowledge. If she figures something out, she teaches her friends immediately. |
| **Patient** | Unlike many kids, Ruby understands that some things take time. She plants seeds and waits for them to grow. This is her core financial metaphor. |
| **Honest** | Ruby does not pretend to know things she doesn't. When she is wrong, she says so. When something is hard, she admits it. This makes her trustworthy. |
| **Determined** | Once Ruby sets a goal, she does not quit. She might adjust her plan, but she never abandons the mission. Rhinos charge. |

### Backstory
Ruby lives in Goldhorn Village with her grandmother, Nana Grace (a retired teacher who raised Ruby after her parents moved to another city for work -- they visit often and love her, but Nana Grace is her daily anchor). Nana Grace taught Ruby one rule early: *"Money is a tool, baby. Learn how to use it, and it'll build you a life. Ignore it, and it'll build somebody else's."*

Ruby took that lesson and ran with it. She started a savings jar at age 5. By age 8, she had saved enough to buy her own bicycle -- the Ruby Red Rider -- which she uses to travel around Goldhorn Village helping her friends solve money problems.

### Catchphrases

| Catchphrase | When Used |
|-------------|-----------|
| **"Let's charge!"** | When starting a new adventure or tackling a money problem |
| **"Save it, grow it, share it."** | Ruby's personal money motto -- the three things you do with money |
| **"Think before you spend -- that's the Ruby Rule."** | When a friend is about to make an impulse purchase |
| **"My horn is glowing!"** | When Ruby has a breakthrough idea (her golden horn glows) |
| **"Every coin counts."** | Encouraging friends who think their small amounts of money don't matter |
| **"What would Nana Grace say?"** | When Ruby needs wisdom -- she channels her grandmother |
| **"That's a want, not a need."** | Core lesson delivered gently, not judgmentally |

### Ruby's Treasured Items
1. **The Money Map** -- A hand-drawn map inside her messenger bag that shows the "Land of Saving," the "Forest of Earning," the "Mountain of Investing," and the "River of Giving." Ruby adds to this map as she learns new lessons.
2. **The Golden Jar** -- Ruby's savings jar. It is clear glass with a gold lid. She can always see how much is inside. Transparency matters.
3. **The Ruby Red Rider** -- Her bicycle. She earned it herself through saving. It represents the first big purchase she made with her own money.

|-----------|--------|
| **Species** | Meerkat |
| **Age** | 8 |
| **Personality** | Impulsive, enthusiastic, warm-hearted, easily distracted by shiny things |
| **Core struggle** | Milo wants EVERYTHING. New toys, candy, gadgets -- he sees it, he wants it. He is not bad or greedy. He simply has not learned to distinguish wants from needs. |
| **Teaching role** | Milo is the character kids see themselves in. He makes the mistakes. He learns alongside the audience. His arc is about developing self-control and delayed gratification. |
| **Appearance** | Tan/sandy colored, slightly smaller than Ruby. Wears a bright yellow backpack that is always overflowing with random stuff he bought. Big, excited eyes. Perpetually slightly disheveled. |
| **Catchphrase** | "But I NEED it!" (which Ruby gently corrects: "Do you need it, or do you want it?") |

| **Personality** | Wise, witty, slightly sarcastic but always kind. Loves telling stories about "the old days." Has traveled the world and seen many different types of money. |

| **Teaching role** | History of money, different currencies, why things cost what they cost, inflation (explained simply as "prices going up over time") |
| **Appearance** | Silver-gray feathers with a flash of red on her tail. Wears tiny round glasses perched on her beak. Carries an old leather-bound book called "Penny's Money Tales." |
| **Catchphrase** | "Let me tell you a story..." and "A penny saved is a penny that works for you." |
| **Relationship to Ruby** | Penny is Ruby's mentor figure among friends. Ruby goes to Penny when she needs context -- when she needs to understand not just WHAT to do, but WHY. |

### Character 3: FELIX THE FOX
**Role:** The Entrepreneur / Earner

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Species** | Red Fox |
| **Age** | 9 |
| **Personality** | Creative, resourceful, always coming up with business ideas. Some work, some don't -- and that is the lesson. Felix is not a "hustler" stereotype. He is a kid who genuinely loves creating things and figuring out how to earn. |
| **Core function** | Felix teaches earning, entrepreneurship, and the value of work. He runs a lemonade stand, a dog-walking service, a comic book trading business. He learns through trial and error that earning requires effort, planning, and serving others. |
| **Teaching role** | Earning money, starting small businesses, the difference between a job and a business, how to add value, why people pay for things |
| **Appearance** | Orange-red fur, lean and quick-looking. Wears a green apron (from his lemonade stand) and carries a small notebook where he writes business ideas. |
| **Catchphrase** | "I have an idea!" and "If you solve a problem, people will pay you for it." |

**Role:** The Planner / Budgeter

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Species** | Burrowing Owl |
| **Age** | 9 |
| **Personality** | Thoughtful, organized, quiet, and detail-oriented. Olive is the friend who always has a plan. She thinks before she acts. She makes lists. She counts twice. |
| **Core function** | Olive teaches budgeting, planning, goal-setting, and patience. She is the one who helps the group figure out how much something ACTUALLY costs, how long it will take to save, and what they need to give up to get what they want. |
| **Teaching role** | Budgeting, goal-setting, math of money, patience, trade-offs, opportunity cost (explained simply as "if you buy this, you can't buy that") |
| **Appearance** | Small, brown and cream feathers, enormous thoughtful eyes. Wears a purple scarf and always has a small chalkboard and chalk for doing math. |
| **Catchphrase** | "Let's do the math." and "A plan is just a goal with steps." |
| **Relationship to Ruby** | Olive is Ruby's strategic partner. When Ruby has an idea, Olive helps her plan it out. They complement each other -- Ruby is the energy, Olive is the structure. |

### Character 5: BANKS THE BEAR
**Role:** The Protector / Saver

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Species** | Black Bear |
| **Age** | 10 (oldest in the group) |
| **Personality** | Gentle, protective, cautious, and strong. Banks is the friend who holds onto things. He does not spend easily. He is the most naturally frugal character -- but his arc is learning that saving TOO much (and never using money for good) is also a problem. |
| **Core function** | Banks teaches saving, protecting what you have, the concept of an emergency fund, and -- importantly -- that money is a tool to be USED, not just hoarded. His name is a double meaning: banks (financial institutions) and the name Banks (strong, reliable). |
| **Teaching role** | Saving, emergency funds, protecting money, banks and how they work, the balance between saving and living |
| **Appearance** | Large, dark brown/black fur, soft and approachable despite his size. Wears a blue vest with lots of pockets (each pocket has coins or small items he is "saving for later"). |
| **Catchphrase** | "I'm saving that for a rainy day." and "Strong saves build strong futures." |
| **Relationship to Ruby** | Banks is Ruby's protective older friend. He walks her home. He carries heavy things. He is loyal and steady. Ruby teaches him that it is OK to spend on things that matter. |

### Character 6: GRACE "NANA GRACE" THE ELEPHANT
**Role:** The Wisdom Figure / Grandparent Archetype

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Species** | African Elephant |
| **Age** | Elderly (exact age never stated) |
| **Personality** | Warm, patient, deeply wise, and full of stories. Nana Grace is a retired teacher who raised Ruby. She speaks in simple truths that land hard. She never lectures -- she asks questions that make you think. |
| **Core function** | Nana Grace is the emotional anchor of the brand. She represents the wisdom that gets passed between generations. She is the reason Ruby knows what she knows. When the lessons get deep -- generational wealth, legacy, giving back -- Nana Grace is the voice. |
| **Teaching role** | Generational wealth, legacy, giving, family financial planning, the "why" behind all money lessons |
| **Appearance** | Large, warm gray, slightly wrinkled (distinguished, not frail). Wears a flowing golden shawl and reading glasses on a chain around her neck. Her home is filled with books, plants, and a large wooden table where the friends gather. |
| **Catchphrase** | "Money is a tool, baby. Learn how to use it, and it'll build you a life." and "What you build today, your grandchildren will stand on." |
| **Relationship to Ruby** | Grandmother and primary caregiver. Nana Grace is the origin of Ruby's financial wisdom. Every lesson Ruby teaches her friends traces back to something Nana Grace taught her first. |

## 2C. THE WORLD: GOLDHORN VILLAGE

### Setting
Goldhorn Village is a small, vibrant, diverse community where the characters live. It is not a fantasy world -- it looks and feels like a real neighborhood. Houses, shops, a school, a park, a community garden, a small market. The village is warm, safe, and full of color.

### Key Locations

| Location | Description | Story Function |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Nana Grace's House** | A warm, book-filled home with a big kitchen table and a garden out back. The gathering place. | Where lessons begin. The "home base." |
| **The Goldhorn Market** | A small outdoor market where villagers sell goods. Felix has his lemonade stand here. | Where earning, spending, and value are explored. |
| **The Savings Tree** | A large, ancient golden oak in the center of the village park. The friends gather under it. | Where the group discusses money goals. Visual metaphor for growth. |
| **The Coin Pond** | A pond where villagers toss coins and make wishes. Ruby challenges: "What if instead of wishing, you planned?" | Where wants vs. needs and goal-setting lessons happen. |
| **Goldhorn School** | The local school. The friends attend together. | Where formal "classroom" lessons can be taught. |
| **The Fix-It Shop** | A small repair shop run by Mr. Tusk (a warthog). He fixes things instead of throwing them away. | Where value, resourcefulness, and anti-consumerism are taught. |

# 3. VISUAL IDENTITY

## 3A. COLOR PALETTE

### Primary Colors

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Ruby Red** | #C0392B | Primary brand color. Ruby's bag, shoes, book covers, CTAs |
| **Golden Horn** | #D4A934 | Secondary brand color. Nana Grace's shawl, the Savings Tree, accents, Ruby's horn |
| **Warm Gray** | #8C837A | Ruby's skin tone, backgrounds, neutral elements |

### Secondary Colors

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Soft Cream** | #FDF6E3 | Page backgrounds, book interiors, warm base |
| **Village Green** | #5B8C5A | Felix's apron, nature elements, the garden, growth metaphors |
| **Sky Blue** | #5DADE2 | Banks' vest, trust, calm, water elements |
| **Plum Purple** | #7D3C98 | Olive's scarf, planning/thinking visuals |
| **Sunshine Yellow** | #F4D03F | Milo's backpack, energy, excitement, highlights |

### Color Rules
- **Ruby Red + Golden Horn** together = the signature combination. Use on all core brand materials.
- **Soft Cream** is the default background. Never pure white (too sterile) or pure black (too harsh for children's brand).
- Every character has an assigned color. This creates instant recognition even in silhouette.
- Avoid neon. Avoid pastels that are too washed out. The palette is warm, rich, and grounded -- like the lessons.

## 3B. TYPOGRAPHY RECOMMENDATIONS

| Use Case | Font Recommendation | Style |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Logo / Headers** | **Baloo 2** (Google Fonts, free) or **Fredoka One** | Rounded, friendly, bold. Feels playful but not juvenile. |
| **Body Text (Books)** | **Quicksand** (Google Fonts, free) or **Nunito** | Clean, readable, warm. Large size for young readers (14-16pt minimum). |
| **Accent / Callouts** | **Patrick Hand** (Google Fonts, free) | Handwritten feel for Ruby's notes, the Money Map, and chalkboard moments. |
| **Numbers / Money** | **Poppins Bold** (Google Fonts, free) | Clean, modern, and easy to read for dollar amounts and math. |

### Typography Rules
- **Minimum body text size:** 14pt for ages 4-7, 12pt for ages 8-12
- **Line spacing:** 1.5x minimum in all children's materials
- **Never use more than 2 fonts** on a single page or product
- **Logo font should be custom-lettered** once budget allows -- Baloo 2 or Fredoka One as placeholder

## 3C. ILLUSTRATION STYLE

### Art Direction
The illustration style for Ruby the Rhino is **warm, textured, and semi-realistic** -- not flat vector art, not hyper-cartoon. Think of the visual warmth of a Studio Ghibli background combined with the character expressiveness of *Doc McStuffins* or *Alma's Way*.

### Style Specifications

| Element | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| **Character style** | Rounded, proportioned, expressive. Characters should feel huggable. Not rubbery or overly exaggerated. |
| **Background style** | Warm, slightly textured (watercolor grain or colored pencil texture). Not flat. Feels handmade. |
| **Color application** | Rich, saturated but not neon. Warm lighting -- like golden hour in every scene. |
| **Line work** | Soft, slightly varied line weight. Not uniform vector lines. Feels drawn by hand. |
| **Emotion** | Characters should be EXPRESSIVE. Eyes do the heavy lifting. Ruby's eyes convey curiosity, pride, confusion, determination -- all clearly. |
| **Diversity** | Goldhorn Village is visually diverse. Incidental human characters (if any appear) reflect the diversity of the real world. The animal characters themselves represent diverse personality types and backgrounds. |
| **Cultural touches** | Nana Grace's house has African-inspired textiles, art, and patterns integrated naturally -- not performatively. The culture is present, not spotlighted. |

### AI Art Tool Recommendations (MVP Phase)

| Tool | Best For | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| **Midjourney** | Character design, cover art, hero images | $10/mo (Basic) |
| **Leonardo.ai** | Consistent character sheets, multiple poses | Free tier available, $12/mo for pro |
| **DALL-E 3 (ChatGPT Plus)** | Quick concept art, social media graphics | $20/mo (included with ChatGPT Plus) |
| **Canva AI** | Social templates, activity sheets, merch mockups | Free tier available, $13/mo for Pro |

### Character Consistency Protocol
For AI-generated illustrations, create a **character reference sheet** for each character showing:
1. Front view, side view, 3/4 view
2. 5 key expressions (happy, curious, surprised, determined, thinking)
3. Full body with outfit details
4. Color swatches for exact reproduction

Use Midjourney's `--cref` (character reference) or Leonardo.ai's character consistency feature to maintain look across illustrations.

# 4. BRAND VOICE & TONE

## 4A. HOW RUBY TALKS

Ruby speaks like a smart 8-year-old who has been taught well by her grandmother. She does not sound like an adult pretending to be a kid. She does not use baby talk. She speaks clearly, simply, and with genuine enthusiasm.

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | How It Sounds |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Simple, not simplistic** | "When you save money, it grows over time -- like planting a seed and watching it become a tree." NOT: "Compound interest accrues on principal balances." |
| **Encouraging, not preachy** | "You can do this! Let's figure it out together." NOT: "You should really be saving more." |
| **Curious, not lecturing** | "Have you ever wondered why things cost more than they used to?" NOT: "Let me explain inflation to you." |
| **Confident, not bossy** | "I learned something cool -- want to hear it?" NOT: "You need to listen to this." |
| **Real, not perfect** | "I made a mistake once. I spent all my money on stickers and then couldn't buy the book I really wanted. That's how I learned about the Ruby Rule." |

### Writing Rules for Ruby Content

1. **Sentences:** 8-15 words maximum. Short and punchy.
2. **Vocabulary:** Kindergarten through 5th grade reading level. If a word has more than 3 syllables, define it or replace it.
3. **Money terms:** Always define on first use. "Saving means keeping some of your money for later."
4. **Questions:** Ruby asks the reader questions frequently. "What would YOU save for?"
5. **Repetition:** Key concepts get repeated across stories. Kids learn through repetition. This is intentional.
6. **Humor:** Light, situational humor. Milo being dramatic about wanting things. Felix's business ideas that hilariously fail before he gets one right. Never mean-spirited.
7. **Emotional honesty:** Characters feel frustrated, confused, disappointed, and excited. Money is emotional. The brand does not pretend otherwise.

## 4B. TAGLINE OPTIONS

| # | Tagline | Best For |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | **"Save it. Grow it. Share it."** | Core brand tagline. Ruby's personal motto. Works on everything. |
| 2 | **"Let's charge!"** | Action tagline. Campaign launches, book openings, social calls to action. |
| 3 | **"Big lessons for little legends."** | Book series subtitle. Speaks to both kids and parents. |
| 4 | **"Every coin counts."** | Savings-focused campaigns. Piggy bank merch. Activity books. |
| 5 | **"Smart money starts young."** | Parent-facing marketing. School partnerships. Institutional messaging. |
| 6 | **"The money lessons nobody taught us -- for the kids who deserve them."** | Long-form tagline. About page. Kickstarter. Emotional storytelling. |
| 7 | **"Where kids learn to build wealth."** | Website hero section. YouTube channel description. |
| 8 | **"Strong saves build strong futures."** | Banks-focused merch. Savings campaigns. |
| 9 | **"What you build today, your grandchildren will stand on."** | Legacy messaging. Parent-facing. Nana Grace's wisdom. |
| 10 | **"Charge toward your dreams."** | Aspirational. Merch. Motivational. |

**Primary tagline recommendation:** "Save it. Grow it. Share it." -- simple, rhythmic, actionable, and maps to Ruby's three-part philosophy about money.

**BOOK 1: "Ruby and the Golden Jar"**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Target lesson** | Saving -- the foundation of all financial literacy |
| **Summary** | Ruby wants a bicycle. She sees the Ruby Red Rider in the Goldhorn Market window and falls in love. But it costs 50 gold coins -- way more than she has. Nana Grace gives Ruby a clear glass jar with a golden lid and says, "Fill this jar, and the bike is yours." Ruby starts saving -- a coin from her allowance, a coin from helping Mr. Tusk at the Fix-It Shop, a coin from selling lemonade with Felix. Milo tries to get her to spend on candy and toys along the way. Banks encourages her to keep going. Olive helps her count and make a plan. It takes months. Ruby gets frustrated. She almost gives up. But she keeps charging. The day she drops the 50th coin in the jar, the CLINK echoes through the house. She rides the Ruby Red Rider home, and Nana Grace says: "You did not just buy a bicycle, baby. You proved to yourself that you can build anything, one coin at a time." |
| **Key vocabulary** | Saving, earning, goal, patience, coins, needs vs. wants |
| **Ruby's Challenge (back pages)** | Draw your own Golden Jar. Write what you are saving for. How many coins do you need? |
| **Emotional arc** | Desire > Plan > Struggle > Temptation > Persistence > Achievement > Pride |

---

**BOOK 2: "Ruby and the Lemonade Lesson"**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Target lesson** | Earning -- how money is made through work, creativity, and solving problems |
| **Summary** | Felix has a big idea: a lemonade stand at the Goldhorn Market. He asks Ruby and friends to help. They invest their saved coins to buy lemons, sugar, and cups. First day: disaster. The lemonade is too sour, nobody buys any, and they lose money. Milo panics. Banks wants to quit. But Ruby says, "Let's charge!" They listen to their customers (Penny interviews people at the market), fix the recipe (Olive calculates the right portions), and add a special touch -- Ruby's Red Lemonade with a secret berry twist. Day two: they sell out. They earn back their investment AND make a profit. Felix learns that a business is not about what YOU like -- it is about what PEOPLE NEED. Ruby teaches everyone the concept of "spending money to make money" -- but only when you have a plan. |
| **Key vocabulary** | Earning, business, customers, profit, investment, problem-solving |
| **Ruby's Challenge (back pages)** | Draw your own business. What would you sell? Who would buy it? How much would you charge? |

---

**BOOK 3: "Ruby and the Giving Tree"**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Target lesson** | Sharing / generosity -- money is a tool for helping others and building community |
| **Summary** | A big storm hits Goldhorn Village and damages the community garden where families grow food. Nana Grace tells Ruby, "Some things are more important than money in a jar." Ruby organizes her friends to raise money to rebuild the garden. Each character contributes their strength: Felix earns money through extra work, Olive creates a budget for the rebuild, Banks donates from his savings (a huge moment -- he learns that spending on community IS an investment), Milo gives up buying a toy he wanted to contribute, and Penny tells stories at a village fundraiser. Together, they raise enough to not just rebuild the garden -- but make it bigger. A new sign goes up: "The Goldhorn Community Garden -- Built by the Village, for the Village." Nana Grace stands beside Ruby and says, "What you build today, your grandchildren will stand on." |
| **Key vocabulary** | Giving, community, donation, fundraising, generosity, investment in people |
| **Ruby's Challenge (back pages)** | What is something in YOUR community that needs help? How could you and your friends help? Draw a plan. |
| **Emotional arc** | Crisis > Compassion > Mobilization > Sacrifice > Teamwork > Abundance > Legacy |

## 5D. BOARD GAME / CARD GAME

### Game 1: "Ruby's Golden Jar" -- The Card Game

**Type:** Card game for 2-4 players, ages 5+
**Play time:** 15-20 minutes
**Concept:** Players collect "coin cards" to fill their golden jar. But SPENDING cards tempt them along the way. EARNING cards let them gain extra coins. SURPRISE cards introduce unexpected expenses ("Uh oh, you dropped your coins!") and windfalls ("Nana Grace gave you a birthday gift!").

**Win condition:** First player to reach their savings goal wins.

**Teaching elements:**
- Saving vs. spending decisions every turn
- Delayed gratification (you can spend now or save for a bigger reward)
- Unexpected expenses (why emergency funds matter)
- Earning opportunities (bonus coins for "helping" cards)

**Production path:** The Game Crafter (print-on-demand board games, no minimum order)
**Cost:** $8-12/unit to produce
**Retail:** $19.99

### Game 2: "Goldhorn Market" -- The Board Game (Future)

**Type:** Board game for 2-6 players, ages 7+
**Concept:** Players move around Goldhorn Village, earning money through jobs and businesses, saving in their jars, investing in the community garden (which pays dividends), and navigating "life cards" that introduce real financial scenarios. A simplified, child-friendly version of cash flow concepts.

**This is a Phase 2 product** -- develop after the card game proves demand.

## 5E. RUBY'S GOLDEN JAR -- SAVINGS JAR MERCH

### Product: Clear Savings Jar with Golden Lid

**Design:** A clear plastic (or glass for premium) jar with a golden screw-top lid. Ruby's face is printed on the front with the words "Save it. Grow it. Share it." Three sections are marked on the jar with colored bands:
- **Red band (top third):** SAVE
- **Gold band (middle third):** GROW
- **Green band (bottom third):** SHARE

This teaches the three-part allocation: some money to save, some to invest/grow, some to give.

**Included:** A small "My Savings Goal" card that slides into a pocket on the front of the jar. The child writes their goal and can see it every time they add money.

**Production:** Alibaba custom manufacturing (MOQ 100-500 units) or print-on-demand for labels on existing jars.

# 6. 12 CORE MONEY LESSONS

These are the foundational financial literacy concepts Ruby teaches, translated for ages 4-12. Each lesson maps to specific products and content.

| # | Lesson | What Kids Learn | Ruby's Simple Explanation | Product/Content Map |
|---|--------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Saving** | Keeping some money for later instead of spending it all | "Every coin you save is a brick in your castle. The more bricks, the stronger your castle." | Book 1, Golden Jar, Episode 6 |
| 2 | **Earning** | Money comes from work, creativity, and solving problems | "Nobody gives you money for nothing. But if you help people or make something cool, they'll happily pay you." | Book 2, Episode 3, Episode 9 |
| 3 | **Spending Wisely** | Thinking before you buy -- needs vs. wants | "Before you buy something, ask yourself: Do I NEED this, or do I WANT this? Both are OK, but know the difference." | Episode 2, Activity Book, Card Game |
| 4 | **Giving** | Using money to help others and build community | "The coolest thing about money is you can use it to help people who need it. That's not losing money. That's investing in your village." | Book 3, Episode 11, Golden Jar (Share section) |
| 5 | **Budgeting** | Planning how to use your money before you spend it | "A budget is just a MAP for your money. Without a map, your money wanders off and gets lost." | Episode 4, Activity Book, Olive worksheets |
| 6 | **Goal-Setting** | Saving for something specific, not just saving to save | "What are you saving FOR? Write it down. Draw it. Look at it every day. That's what keeps you charging." | Book 1, Activity Book, Golden Jar goal card |
| 7 | **Patience** | Good things take time -- delayed gratification | "Milo wanted the toy NOW. Ruby waited 3 months and got the bicycle. Who made the better choice?" | Book 1, Episode 2, Card Game |
| 8 | **Value** | Understanding what things are worth and why | "A glass of water in your kitchen? Free. A glass of water in the desert? Priceless. Value depends on where, when, and who." | Episode 7, Book 4 (future) |
| 9 | **Growing Money** | The basics of how saved money can grow (interest, investing -- simplified) | "If you plant one apple seed and take care of it, eventually you get a whole tree full of apples. Money can grow the same way." | Book 7 (future), Episode 1 |
| 10 | **Protecting Money** | Why you don't leave money lying around -- banks, safety, emergency funds | "Banks is smart. He keeps his money safe. Because if you lose it, you can't save it, grow it, or share it." | Episode 5, Episode 10, Book 5 (future) |
| 11 | **Borrowing & Debt** | What it means to borrow and why you MUST pay it back | "Borrowing is not bad. But when you borrow, you are using FUTURE you's money. So be sure it's worth it." | Book 10 (future), advanced episodes |
| 12 | **Generational Wealth** | Building something that helps your family for generations | "Nana Grace planted a garden 30 years ago. Ruby eats from it today. That's what building wealth means -- planting trees whose shade you might never sit in." | Book 3, Book 12 (future), Episode 12 |

# 7. CONTENT STRATEGY

## 7A. SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY

### Two-Channel Approach

The Ruby brand runs two parallel social presences:

**Channel 1: Kid-Focused (Ruby's World)**
- **Platforms:** YouTube (primary), TikTok (secondary)
- **Content:** Animated shorts, read-aloud clips, activity challenges, "Ask Ruby" Q&A
- **Voice:** Ruby speaks directly to kids. Fun, bright, fast-paced.
- **Goal:** Build audience of kids who watch, learn, and ask parents for Ruby products
- **Posting cadence:** 2-3 videos/week on YouTube, daily TikTok clips (repurposed from YouTube)

**Channel 2: Parent-Focused (Ruby's Mission)**
- **Platforms:** Instagram (primary), Facebook (secondary), Pinterest (tertiary)
- **Content:** Parenting tips for teaching kids about money, behind-the-scenes of the brand, testimonials, printable worksheets, "conversation starter" posts
- **Voice:** Warm, empowering, educational. Speaks to parents as allies, not students.
- **Goal:** Build trust with parents who buy products, share content, and use Ruby's lessons at home
- **Posting cadence:** Daily Instagram (mix of carousels, reels, stories), 3x/week Facebook

### Content Pillars (Social)

# 11. CONNECTION TO JAMAAL'S EMPIRE

## 11A. THE FUNNEL BRIDGE: RUBY --> MONEY DECODED --> J. MARQUE

This is the strategic genius of Ruby the Rhino. She is not just a children's brand -- she is the top of a multi-generational funnel.

```
GENERATION FUNNEL MAP

[KIDS] ─── Ruby the Rhino books, videos, products
              │
              │ (Parent discovers Ruby's content)
              │
[PARENTS] ── "If my kid is learning about money...
              maybe I should too."
              │
              │ (CTA in Ruby materials: "Parents: Want to level up YOUR
              │  financial education? Get the FREE ebook at MoneyDecoded.com")
              │
[J. MARQUE] ─ Money Decoded Book 1 (FREE lead magnet)
              │
              │ (Standard J. Marque funnel kicks in)
              │
              ├── $7 Trilogy

              ├── $97-$197 Track product
              └── $5,997 Group coaching

RESULT: One Ruby the Rhino book sale can become a $5,997 coaching client.
```

### Integration Points

| Ruby Product | J. Marque Bridge |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Every Ruby book (back page)** | "A Note to Parents: Ruby teaches your kids about money. But who taught YOU? Get the free ebook that started a movement: MoneyDecoded.com" |
| **Ruby email list** | Parents who subscribe get a parallel nurture sequence: "Ruby is teaching your kids. Here's what the adults need to know." with link to Money Decoded Book 1. |
| **Ruby YouTube description** | Every video: "Parents -- want to learn what Ruby's teaching? Free book for adults: [link]" |
| **Ruby Instagram bio** | "Teaching kids money skills. Parents: level up YOUR financial literacy --> [MoneyDecoded link]" |
| **Ruby's Golden Jar (physical)** | Insert card in box: "Your child just took the first step toward financial literacy. Now it's YOUR turn. Free book: MoneyDecoded.com" |
| **School partnerships** | Offer parent workshops alongside student programs: "Financial Literacy Family Night" powered by J. Marque content |

### Revenue Multiplier Effect

| If Ruby generates... | And 10% of parents enter J. Marque funnel... | Potential additional revenue: |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1,000 book sales/month | 100 parents opt in for Money Decoded | 100 leads x $10.66/lead = $1,066/month from Ruby alone |
| 5,000 book sales/month | 500 parents opt in | 500 x $10.66 = $5,330/month |
| School district partnership (5,000 families) | 500 parents opt in | One-time surge: $5,330 + ongoing engagement |

*$10.66/lead projection comes from the GHL Automation Blueprint for the Money Decoded funnel.*

## 11B. CROSS-PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES

| From | To | How |
|------|-----|-----|
| Money Decoded email list | Ruby the Rhino | "Got kids? Your child needs this." → Ruby book + products |
| Pipeline Mastery students | Ruby the Rhino | "Your clients are families. Give them Ruby books as a closing gift." → Wholesale orders |
| Vaulted Capital investors | Ruby the Rhino | "Your portfolio matters. So does your legacy. Start them young." → Gift sets |
| Ruby social following | J. Marque social following | Cross-promote on parent-facing channels |
| Ruby school partnerships | J. Marque parent workshops | Bundle children's curriculum with adult financial literacy night |

## 11C. THE LEGACY PLAY

This is where it all connects.

Jamaal's stated mission: **establishing generational wealth for OTHER families, not just his own.**

- **J. Marque / Money Decoded** teaches adults how to build wealth.
- **Pipeline Mastery** teaches professionals how to execute in real estate.
- **Vaulted Capital** provides the capital infrastructure.
- **Ruby the Rhino** teaches the NEXT GENERATION before the system gets to them first.

Ruby is not a side project. Ruby is the long game. She is the answer to: "What happens when the kids these parents are raising grow up already knowing what we had to learn the hard way?"

Ruby the Rhino is how Jamaal's mission outlives Jamaal.

When Isaac -- now 3 years old -- is 10, Ruby will have been in the world for 7 years. If this brand does what it is designed to do, Isaac will grow up in a world where thousands of kids his age already understand saving, earning, budgeting, giving, and building. That is the legacy. Not a brand. A generation.

# 12. LEGAL & IP PROTECTION

## 12A. TRADEMARK

| Action | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Trademark "Ruby the Rhino" (wordmark) | TO DO | File with USPTO. Class 16 (printed matter), Class 28 (games/toys), Class 41 (education/entertainment). ~$250-350/class. |
| Trademark "Save it. Grow it. Share it." | TO DO | File as a slogan mark. ~$250-350. |
| Trademark Ruby character design | TO DO | File after character art is finalized. Design mark. ~$250-350. |

**Priority:** File the wordmark "Ruby the Rhino" FIRST. This is the most important IP to protect. File the others once revenue supports it.

**DIY filing:** USPTO.gov TEAS Plus application. No attorney needed for basic filing.

## 12B. COPYRIGHT

- All book manuscripts are automatically copyrighted upon creation.
- Register with US Copyright Office ($65/work) for stronger legal protection.

## 12C. LLC STRUCTURE

| Option | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Gold Rhino** (existing LLC) | Could house Ruby the Rhino. Keeps everything under the rhino brand umbrella. Needs to be brought into good standing first. |
| **New LLC: Ruby the Rhino LLC** | Cleaner separation. Protects the children's brand from liability in other businesses. Recommended if budget allows. |
| **Legacy Luxe Collective** (Tia's LLC) | Could be used temporarily for transactions while Gold Rhino is restored. |

**Recommendation:** Launch under Gold Rhino (once in good standing). Spin into its own LLC when revenue justifies it.

Any physical product marketed to children under 12 must comply with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act:
- Lead testing for all materials
- CPSIA tracking labels on products

```
(Verse)
My name is Ruby, I'm a rhino with a plan
Got my golden jar and my money in my hand
Save it, grow it, share it -- that's the way to go
Every single coin counts, now you're in the know

(Chorus)
Let's charge! Let's charge!
Big dreams don't have to be far
Let's charge! Let's charge!
You're a money superstar

(Bridge)
Milo's learning patience, Felix starts to earn
Olive does the math, and Penny helps us learn
Banks is keeping safe, and Nana shows the way
Ruby and her friends are here to save the day

(Chorus)
Let's charge! Let's charge!
Big dreams don't have to be far
Let's charge! Let's charge!
You're a money superstar
```

**Production:** Generate with Suno AI ($0-10/mo). Refine with a producer if it gains traction.
