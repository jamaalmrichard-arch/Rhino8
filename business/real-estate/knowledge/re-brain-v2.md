## MY MISSION
Buy 100 rental units in 2026. Scale to 1,000 units over time.
Build a portfolio I can either hold for cash flow or sell for a massive payout.
Use wholesaling, subject-to, and creative finance to generate cash and acquire with little/no money down.
Package this system as a sellable framework: "Pipeline Mastery."

## INVESTMENT STRATEGIES (in order of priority)
1. **Wholesaling** — Generate $5K-$25K per deal to fund acquisitions. Goal: 4-6 deals/month.
2. **Subject-To** — Take over existing mortgages (especially low-rate loans) for instant cash-flowing rentals with little/no money down.
3. **Seller Financing** — Negotiate terms directly with sellers: price, rate, term, down payment.
4. **BRRRR** — Buy distressed, rehab, rent, refinance, repeat. Recover capital and keep rental.
5. **Fix & Flip** — Larger cash injections ($20K-$60K profit) for down payments on multifamily.
6. **Multifamily (5-50 units)** — Value-add apartments to scale unit count fast.
7. **Wraparound Mortgages** — Create new note wrapping existing debt; collect spread on payments.
8. **Lease Options** — Control property with option to buy; collect rent and option premium.

## WHOLESALING — EXPERT KNOWLEDGE BASE

### What Wholesaling IS
- You find distressed/discounted properties and get them under contract
- You assign that contract (your equitable interest) to a cash buyer for an assignment fee
- You NEVER own the property, NEVER do repairs, NEVER need a loan
- You are an information broker and deal finder — a logistics business
- Legal in all 50 states but regulations are tightening (see compliance section)

### The Wholesaling Process (Step by Step)
1. **Lead Generation** — Find motivated sellers via direct mail, cold calling, driving for dollars, PPC, bandit signs, skip tracing, MLS expired/withdrawn, probate lists, pre-foreclosure lists, tax delinquent lists, absentee owners, code violations, inherited properties
2. **Lead Qualification** — Determine motivation level (1-10), timeline, property condition, financial situation, asking price vs. realistic value
3. **Appointment / Property Visit** — Walk the property, estimate repairs, build rapport with seller
4. **Run the Numbers** — ARV, repair costs, MAO using 70% rule, rental income potential
5. **Make the Offer** — Present purchase agreement with assignment clause, earnest money ($500-$2,000)
6. **Get Under Contract** — Sign PSA with inspection period (10-14 days)
7. **Disposition (Find Your Buyer)** — Blast deal to cash buyer list, post on investor forums, call top buyers
8. **Assign the Contract** — Sign Assignment of Contract with buyer, collect non-refundable deposit
9. **Close at Title Company** — Title company handles closing, pays seller, cuts you assignment fee check
10. **Reinvest** — Put profits back into marketing. Never stop lead generating.

### Key Formulas
```
MAO (Maximum Allowable Offer) = ARV x 0.70 - Repair Costs - Your Assignment Fee
Assignment Fee = Buyer's Purchase Price - Your Contract Price
Wholesale Spread = ARV - Repair Costs - Buyer's Desired Profit - Your Fee
```

### Wholesaling KPIs & Benchmarks
| KPI | Formula | Benchmark |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| Cost Per Lead (CPL) | Marketing Spend / Total Leads | $20-$150 |
| Cost Per Deal | Total Marketing Spend / Deals Closed | $1,500-$5,000 |
| Lead-to-Contract Rate | Contracts / Total Leads | 1-5% |
| Contract-to-Close Rate | Closed Deals / Contracts Signed | 80%+ |
| Average Assignment Fee | Total Revenue / Deals Closed | $10,000-$25,000 |
| Leads Per Deal | Total Leads / Deals Closed | 20-30 leads per deal |
| Offer Acceptance Rate | Accepted Offers / Total Offers | 10-15% |
| Lead Response Time | Time from lead in to first contact | Under 5 minutes |
| Follow-Up Completion Rate | Completed / Scheduled | 90%+ |
| Marketing ROI | (Revenue - Mktg Cost) / Mktg Cost | 5x-10x+ |
| Avg Days to Close | Sum of close timelines / deals | 14-30 days |

### Wholesaling Pipeline Math
To close 4-6 wholesale deals per month:
- Need 100-180 leads/month (at 3% conversion)
- Need 60-100 offers/month (at 10-15% acceptance)
- Need 5-8 contracts/month (at 80% close rate = 4-6 closings)
- At $10K avg fee = $40K-$60K/month gross revenue
- Marketing budget: $3,000-$8,000/month

### Lead Sources (Ranked by Quality)
1. Driving for Dollars — highest quality, lowest CPL, most time intensive
2. Direct Mail — proven, scalable. Best lists: pre-foreclosure, probate, tax delinquent, absentee, high equity
3. Cold Calling / SMS — fast, cheap with VAs ($4-8/hr offshore). Use skip tracing
4. PPC / Google Ads — "sell my house fast [city]". Higher CPL but very motivated
5. SEO / Carrot Website — long-term inbound play
6. Bandit Signs — check local regulations
7. Networking — REIA meetings, wholesaler meetups, agent referrals
8. MLS — expired, withdrawn, DOM 90+, price reductions
9. Referrals — past sellers, agents, attorneys, contractors
10. Social Media — Facebook groups, YouTube, TikTok

### Contracts Required
1. **Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA)** — MUST include "and/or assigns," inspection period (10-14 days), earnest money ($500-$2,000), closing timeline, disclosure of assignment intent
2. **Assignment of Contract** — Assignment fee, non-refundable deposit from buyer ($2K-$5K)
3. **Proof of Funds Letter** — from HML or transactional lender
4. **Disclosure Addendum** — state-specific as needed

### Double Close (vs. Assignment)
- Use when you don't want to reveal your fee or seller's contract price
- A-B closing (you buy) using transactional funding, then B-C closing (you sell) same day
- Cost: 1-2% of purchase price for 1-3 day funding + two sets of closing costs
- Complete privacy on your spread

### 2025-2026 Compliance (CRITICAL)
- **Georgia:** No specific law yet. Always disclose intent to assign. Market your CONTRACT, not the property.
- **Connecticut (Jul 2026):** Must register. 3-day seller cancellation window.
- **Maryland (Oct 2025):** Must disclose intent to assign. Seller can cancel if undisclosed.
- **Tennessee (Mar 2025):** Must disclose intent and nature of interest.
- **North Dakota:** Rules now apply to ALL real estate types.
- **Best practices everywhere:** Disclose investor status, market contract not property, use title company, consult attorney.

### Cash Buyer List Building
- REIA meetings, county cash transaction records (last 90 days), auction buyers
- PropStream/BatchLeads cash buyer search
- Facebook investor groups, hard money lender referrals
- Minimum 50 active buyers before heavy marketing to sellers
- Segment by: SFR vs multi, price range, rehab tolerance, speed, market area

## SUBJECT-TO DEALS — EXPERT KNOWLEDGE BASE

### What Subject-To IS
- You purchase a property "subject to" the existing mortgage staying in place
- Seller transfers the deed to you — you OWN the property
- Seller's loan stays in seller's name, but YOU make the payments
- You control, rent, build equity — without qualifying for a new loan
- Seller gets relief from payments, avoids foreclosure, preserves credit

### Why Sellers Say Yes
- Facing foreclosure, underwater, divorce, job relocation, inherited property, tired landlord, behind on payments, can't sell traditionally due to condition or negative equity

### Subject-To Deal Structure
1. Find motivated seller (filter for: HAS a mortgage, wants OUT)
2. Verify loan details: lender, servicer, balance, rate, payment (PITI), missed payments, loan type, prepayment penalty, escrow balance
3. Negotiate: what does seller need at closing? ($0? Back payments? Small cash?)
4. Execute paperwork (with attorney): Sub-To Purchase Agreement, Warranty Deed, Authorization to Release Info, Limited POA, CYA Letter / Seller Disclosure
5. Close: record deed, set up autopay to servicer, change/add insurance, set up PM
6. Exit: hold as rental, refinance, sell on wrap, lease option, sell outright

### The Due-On-Sale Clause
**What it is:** Contractual right (NOT a law) allowing lender to demand full repayment if property transfers without consent. Lender MAY call, doesn't HAVE to.

**Reality:** Enforcement is extremely rare when payments are current. Lenders lose money on foreclosure. In decades of sub-to investing, actual calls are nearly unheard of.

**Garn-St. Germain Act Exceptions (lender CANNOT call due):**
- Transfer to spouse/children
- Transfer due to death
- Transfer to living trust where borrower is beneficiary AND occupant
- Divorce/separation transfers

**Land Trust Strategy:**
- Seller transfers property into revocable land trust (seller initially beneficiary)
- Seller assigns beneficial interest to you/your LLC
- Lender sees trust (assumes estate planning), doesn't see sale
- NOT bulletproof for investment properties (occupancy requirement), but enforcement remains extremely rare
- Always consult YOUR attorney

**Risk Mitigation:**
- ALWAYS keep payments current
- Set up autopay to servicer
- Maintain insurance (lapse = lender alert)
- Don't contact lender unnecessarily
- Use land trust for privacy
- Have refinance exit plan
- Keep $5K-$10K reserves per sub-to property

### Subject-To Math Example
```
Existing Loan:    $180,000 @ 3.5% (locked 2021)
Monthly PITI:     $1,100
Property FMV:     $230,000
Monthly Rent:     $1,800
Cash to Seller:   $3,000 (back payments + moving money)

Cash Flow:        $1,800 - $1,100 - $150 (PM) - $100 (reserves) = $450/mo
Cash-on-Cash:     ($450 x 12) / $3,000 = 180%
Instant Equity:   $230,000 - $180,000 = $50,000
```

### Strategy Comparison
| Strategy | Own It? | New Loan? | Down Payment | Risk Level |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Subject-To | YES | NO | Little/none | Medium (due-on-sale) |
| Seller Finance | YES | YES (from seller) | Negotiable | Low |
| Lease Option | NO (option) | NO | Option premium | Low |
| Wraparound | YES | YES (wraps existing) | Negotiable | Medium |
| Wholesale | NO | NO | Earnest only | Very Low |
| BRRRR | YES | YES | 20-25% down | Low |

### Wraparound Mortgage (Advanced)
- Buy sub-to existing mortgage, sell to new buyer with seller financing at HIGHER rate
- Collect buyer's payment, pay existing loan, keep the spread
- Example: Existing 3.5%, wrap at 7% — pocket rate spread + principal difference
- MUST use attorney and loan servicing company

## CREATIVE FINANCING SCRIPTS

### Subject-To Script
"I can take over your mortgage payments immediately. You'd no longer worry about the monthly payment, insurance, taxes, or maintenance. I'll put the deed in my name, your loan stays in place, I make every payment on time to protect your credit. You walk away clean. What would you need to make that work?"

### Seller Financing Script
"What if instead of me getting a bank loan, you became the bank? You'd collect monthly payments with interest — better than any savings account. And if I stopped paying, you'd get the house back. Would that work for your situation?"

### Initial Seller Call (Wholesale)
"Hi [Name], I'm calling about your property at [Address]. I'm a local investor, I buy houses in the area. Would you consider an offer? ... Can you tell me about the property and your situation? ... What would you need to get for it? ... If I could make a fair offer and close quickly, would you be open to that?"
