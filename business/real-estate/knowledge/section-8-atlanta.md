## 1. Metro-Level Fair Market Rents

HUD sets Fair Market Rents (FMR) annually at the 40th percentile of gross rents for standard-quality rental housing in a metro area. These are the baseline — local payment standards are derived from these.

### Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell MSA — FMR by Fiscal Year

| Bedroom | FY 2025 | FY 2026 | YoY Change |
|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| 0BR (Efficiency) | $1,591 | $1,585 | -$6 (-0.4%) |
| 1BR | $1,653 | $1,660 | +$7 (+0.4%) |
| 2BR | $1,830 | $1,820 | -$10 (-0.5%) |
| 3BR | $2,205 | $2,182 | -$23 (-1.0%) |
| 4BR | $2,653 | $2,605 | -$48 (-1.8%) |

**Key Notes:**
- FY 2025 effective October 1, 2024. FY 2026 effective October 1, 2025.
- FMR is the metro-wide number. Atlanta uses **Small Area FMRs (SAFMRs)** at the ZIP-code level, which override metro FMR.
- The metro FMR covers Barrow, Bartow, Carroll, Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Coweta, Dawson, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Henry, Jasper, Newton, Paulding, Pickens, and Pike counties.
- FMR represents gross rent (rent + tenant-paid utilities). Utility allowance is subtracted from payment standard to get max contract rent.

---

## 2. DCA Payment Standards by ZIP Code

**CRITICAL:** Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) uses **Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs)** calculated at the ZIP code level. This means payment standards vary significantly by neighborhood. Atlanta adopted SAFMRs effective July 1, 2018.

The DCA payment standard = the maximum total housing cost (rent + utilities) the voucher program will cover.

## 3. Atlanta Housing Payment Standards

**IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:** There are TWO housing authorities serving the City of Atlanta:

1. **Atlanta Housing (AH)** — Administers vouchers within the City of Atlanta limits. MTW agency with special flexibility.
2. **Georgia DCA** — Administers state-level HCV program. Uses SAFMR-based payment standards (data above).
3. **Housing Authority of Fulton County (HAFC)** — Administers vouchers in unincorporated Fulton County and some cities outside Atlanta.

### Atlanta Housing (AH) — Moving to Work (MTW) Agency

Atlanta Housing is one of ~39 MTW agencies nationwide. MTW status gives AH special authority to:
- Set payment standards OUTSIDE the normal 90-110% FMR range (with HUD approval)
- Design alternative rent policies
- Combine funding streams (public housing + voucher)
- Create local programs not available in non-MTW agencies
- Implement self-sufficiency programs with time limits
- Use block grant funding flexibility

**AH Payment Standard Structure:**
- AH uses a **zone-based system** mapped to ZIP codes
- Payment standards are set as a percentage of local SAFMRs
- AH updates payment standards periodically (not always aligned with federal fiscal year)
- As an MTW agency, AH can set standards above 110% of FMR if needed for high-cost areas

**AH Payment Standard Zones (as of most recent published table):**
- AH organizes the city into payment zones based on ZIP codes
- Higher-cost neighborhoods (Midtown, Buckhead-adjacent, Beltline) have higher payment standards
- Lower-cost neighborhoods (Westside, Southside) have lower standards
- The zone map is available at: atlantahousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Payment-Standards-Map_Final-with-Update_02012022.pdf

### How AH Differs from Standard HCV

| Feature | Standard HCV | Atlanta Housing (MTW) |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Payment standard range | 90-110% of FMR | Can exceed 110% with MTW authority |
| Rent calculation | 30% of adjusted income | May use alternative methods |
| Work requirement | None | Can impose work/self-sufficiency requirements |
| Time limits | None (federal program) | Can set program time limits |
| Inspection frequency | Annual | Can use biennial for high-performing |
| Funding flexibility | Restricted | Block grant — can move money between programs |

## 5. How Section 8 Rent Is Determined

### The Rent Formula

```
Payment Standard (by ZIP & bedroom) - Utility Allowance = Maximum Contract Rent

If Tenant's 30% of income < Payment Standard:
  HAP (what landlord gets from HA) = Payment Standard - Tenant's 30% of income - Utility Allowance
  Tenant pays the remainder directly to landlord

If requested rent > Payment Standard:
  Tenant pays the difference out of pocket (but total tenant payment cannot exceed 40% of income at initial lease-up)
```

### Example: 4BR at 1876 Madrona (30318)

```
FY 2026 Payment Standard (30318, 4BR):     $2,930
Estimated Utility Allowance:               -$200 (varies — gas heat, electric, water)
Maximum Contract Rent:                      $2,730

If tenant income = $2,000/mo:
  30% of income = $600
  HAP to landlord = $2,930 - $600 - $200 = $2,130
  Tenant pays landlord = $600
  Total landlord receives = $2,730/mo
```

### Rent Reasonableness Requirement

Before a HAP contract is signed, the housing authority must determine the proposed rent is "reasonable" — meaning comparable to similar unassisted units in the area. The process:

1. **Comparable analysis:** HA compares your unit to 3+ similar unassisted (non-subsidized) rental units nearby
2. **Factors evaluated:** Location, unit size, type (house vs apartment), age, condition, amenities, utilities included
3. **If rent is too high:** HA notifies owner and offers to negotiate. Owner can lower rent or tenant moves on.
4. **If rent is reasonable:** HA issues approval letter and proceeds to contract.
5. **Landlord can submit own comps** to support the rent amount

**Pro tip:** Pull 3-5 comparable rentals from Zillow/Rentometer for the same ZIP, bedroom count, and property type. Submit with your RTA to speed approval.

### Housing Quality Standards (HQS) Inspection

Every unit must pass HQS inspection before a tenant can move in and annually/biennially thereafter.

**13 HQS Performance Requirements:**

| # | Category | Key Items |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Sanitary facilities | Working toilet, sink, tub/shower in bathroom |
| 2 | Food preparation | Stove/oven, refrigerator, sink with hot/cold water |
| 3 | Space and security | Adequate living space, lockable exterior doors |
| 4 | Thermal environment | Working heating system adequate for climate |
| 5 | Illumination/electricity | At least 1 window per habitable room, working outlets |
| 6 | Structure/materials | Sound roof, walls, floors, foundation; no lead paint hazards |
| 7 | Interior air quality | No air pollutant sources at dangerous levels |
| 8 | Water supply | Running hot and cold water, safe and sanitary |
| 9 | Lead-based paint | Compliance with lead paint rules (pre-1978 buildings) |
| 10 | Access | Usable building entrance, no blocked egress |
| 11 | Site and neighborhood | No serious environmental hazards |
| 12 | Sanitary condition | Free of vermin/rodent infestation, trash properly managed |
| 13 | Smoke detectors | Working smoke detectors on every level and near bedrooms |

**Common Fail Items (fix these BEFORE inspection):**
- Missing/dead smoke detector batteries
- Broken window locks
- Peeling paint (critical in pre-1978 homes)
- Missing GFCI outlets in kitchen/bathroom
- Broken handrails on stairs
- Missing outlet/switch covers
- Water heater not to code
- No carbon monoxide detectors (if gas appliances)
- Exterior trip hazards

**Inspection Timeline:**
- Initial inspection requested after RTA submitted
- Inspector contacts landlord within 1 business day
- Inspection scheduled within 5-15 business days
- If PASS: proceed to HAP contract
- If FAIL: 30 days to fix and request re-inspection
- Second fail may result in tenant needing to find another unit

### Utility Allowances

The utility allowance is deducted from the payment standard to determine the maximum contract rent. It varies by:
- Unit type (house, apartment, townhouse)
- Number of bedrooms
- Utility responsibility (who pays what)
- Fuel type (gas vs electric)

**Estimated Atlanta Utility Allowances (approximate — check current HA schedule):**

| Bedroom | Gas Heat + Electric + Water | Electric Only (no gas) |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| 1BR | $100 - $130 | $80 - $110 |
| 2BR | $130 - $170 | $100 - $140 |
| 3BR | $160 - $210 | $130 - $170 |
| 4BR | $180 - $250 | $150 - $200 |

**If landlord pays all utilities:** Utility allowance = $0. Full payment standard becomes max rent.
**If tenant pays all utilities:** Full utility allowance is deducted from payment standard.

### Section 8 Cons / Considerations

1. **Inspection requirements** — Unit must pass HQS initially and annually/biennially
2. **Rent caps** — Cannot charge above payment standard + what tenant can pay
3. **Paperwork** — More administrative burden than market-rate
4. **Timeline** — 45-90 days from listing to first check (slower than market-rate)
5. **Rent increases** — Must request through HA; may not match market appreciation in hot areas
6. **Some payment standards declining** — FY 2026 saw decreases in 30310, 30314, 30331

### Pre-Inspection Checklist for Landlords

- [ ] All smoke detectors installed and working (every level + near bedrooms)
- [ ] Carbon monoxide detectors (if gas appliances)
- [ ] All windows open, close, and lock properly

## Notes

- **DCA vs AH:** DCA payment standards (listed above) apply to DCA-administered vouchers. Atlanta Housing (AH) may set different payment standards under their MTW authority. Always confirm which HA the tenant's voucher is administered by.
- **SAFMR updates:** SAFMRs are recalculated annually. FY 2027 data will be published around August-September 2026.
- **Rent increases:** Landlords can request annual rent increases through the HA. Increases must still pass rent reasonableness.
- **HAP contract term:** Initial 1 year, auto-renews annually. Either party can terminate with 30-day notice.
- **Tax implications:** Section 8 HAP income is taxable rental income. Report on Schedule E.
- **Lead paint:** Properties built before 1978 require lead paint disclosure and may require testing/remediation.
