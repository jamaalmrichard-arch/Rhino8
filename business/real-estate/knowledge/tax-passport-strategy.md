## 1. IRC 7345 PASSPORT REVOCATION

### What It Is

IRC 7345 allows the IRS to certify "seriously delinquent tax debt" to the State Department, which then revokes, denies, or limits the passport.

### Threshold (2025, effective through June 2026)

| Year | Threshold |
|------|-----------|
| 2024 | $62,000 |
| 2025 | $66,000 (adjusted for inflation) |
| 2026 | TBD (likely ~$68,000) |

Your $140K is well above threshold. The IRS sends Notice CP508C when it certifies your debt.

### What "Seriously Delinquent" Means

- Assessed federal tax debt (tax + penalties + interest) exceeding the threshold
- A Notice of Federal Tax Lien has been filed AND the CDP hearing rights have lapsed or been exhausted, OR
- A levy has been issued

### What It Does NOT Include

- Debt being paid under an installment agreement
- Debt under an Offer in Compromise (pending or accepted)
- Debt in CNC (Currently Not Collectible) hardship status
- Debt with a pending CDP hearing (Section 6330)
- Debt of a taxpayer in bankruptcy
- Debt from identity theft
- Debt in a federally declared disaster zone
- Taxpayer serving in a combat zone

## 2. PASSPORT DECERTIFICATION TRIGGERS

**This is the core list. Any ONE of these gets the passport back.**

| # | Action | Decertification Timeline | Passport Restored |
|---|--------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Pay debt in full | IRS reverses within 30 days | ~2-3 weeks after IRS reversal |
| 2 | Enter IRS installment agreement | Within 30 days of agreement | ~2-3 weeks after reversal |
| 3 | OIC accepted OR pending | Within 30 days | ~2-3 weeks after reversal |
| 4 | CNC hardship status granted | Within 30 days | ~2-3 weeks after reversal |
| 5 | Debt drops below threshold (via amended returns + abatement) | Within 30 days | ~2-3 weeks after reversal |
| 6 | CDP hearing requested (Collection Due Process) | While pending | Immediate upon filing |
| 7 | Innocent Spouse Relief (Section 6015) | While pending | Immediate upon filing |
| 8 | Tax Court petition under 7345(e) | While pending | Immediate upon filing |
| 9 | Debt becomes legally unenforceable (CSED expires) | Within 30 days | ~2-3 weeks after reversal |
| 10 | Certification found erroneous | Within 30 days | ~2-3 weeks after reversal |

**Expedited processing:** If you have travel within 45 days or live abroad, the IRS can shorten 30-day processing to 9-16 days.

**State Department emergency:** Can issue passport in emergencies/humanitarian situations regardless of IRS certification.

---

## 3. AMENDED RETURNS (FORM 1040-X)

### Standard Rule

- File within **3 years** of original return filing date, OR **2 years** from date tax was paid, whichever is later
- In February 2026, you can generally amend tax years **2022, 2023, 2024, 2025**

### Critical Distinction: Refund vs. Abatement

| Situation | Time Limit | Applies Here? |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Claiming a refund** (overpaid, want money back) | 3 years from filing / 2 years from payment | Only for recent years |
| **Requesting abatement** (reduce balance owed, no refund) | No strict statutory bar | YES — this is your play |

**Key insight from IRS IRM 4.10.11:** If the amended return asks for a reduction to the liability (not resulting in a credit or refund), it is a **request for abatement**, NOT a claim for refund. The 3-year limitation applies to refund claims, not necessarily to abatement requests.

### What This Means for You

- For years where you OWED tax and still owe a balance, filing an amended return to reduce that balance is an abatement request
- The IRS agent who told you to file amended returns with proper write-offs was giving you correct advice
- Even for years beyond the 3-year refund window, you can potentially reduce the assessed balance
- Consult a tax attorney to confirm this approach for your specific years — this is the single highest-value move

### Special Extended Deadlines

| Circumstance | Extended Period |
|--------------|----------------|
| Bad debt / worthless securities | 7 years from original due date |
| Net operating loss (NOL) carryback | 3 years from loss year return due date |
| Foreign tax credit | 10 years |
| Physical/mental disability (medically certified) | Suspension of time limits |
| Return under IRS examination | May negotiate amendments to earlier years |

### How to File

1. File Form 1040-X for each year being amended
2. Attach Schedule C (or E, depending on activity type) with proper deductions
3. Attach all supporting documentation
4. E-file: Current year and prior 2 years can be e-filed
5. Paper file: Older years must be mailed
6. Processing time: 8-16 weeks per return

---

## 5. OFFER IN COMPROMISE (OIC)

### The Formula

**RCP = Net Quick-Sale Value of Assets + (Monthly Disposable Income x Multiplier)**

Where:
- **Quick-sale value** = ~80% of FMV minus secured debt
- **Monthly disposable income** = Gross monthly income minus IRS-allowed expenses
- **Multiplier** = 12 (lump sum, pay in 5 months) or 24 (periodic, pay 6-24 months)

### Your RCP Calculation (Estimated)

**Income Side:**

| Item | Monthly Amount |
|------|---------------|
| VA Disability | $3,500 |
| SS (rep payee) | $900 |
| **Gross Monthly Income** | **$4,400** |

**IMPORTANT:** VA disability is tax-exempt but the IRS DOES count it as income for OIC ability-to-pay calculations. (Confirmed per Tax Notes case law — veterans disability benefits ARE considered for ability-to-pay purposes.)

**Expense Side (IRS Allowable Standards 2025, single person, Fulton County GA):**

| Category | Monthly Allowance |
|----------|------------------|
| Housing & Utilities (Fulton Co., 1 person) | $2,329 |
| Food, Clothing, Misc (National Std, 1 person) | $839 |
| Transportation (1 car, ownership) | $619 |
| Transportation (operating costs) | $662 |
| Health care (out-of-pocket, under 65) | $84 |
| **Total Allowable Expenses** | **$4,533** |

**Monthly Disposable Income = $4,400 - $4,533 = NEGATIVE $133**

This means your allowable expenses **exceed** your income. Your monthly disposable income for OIC purposes = $0.

**Asset Side:**

| Asset | Quick-Sale Value | Liens/Debt | Net Equity |
|-------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| 1255 North Ave NW | Under renovation — likely minimal or negative equity | Loan balance | ~$0 or negative |
| 1876 Madrona | Closing — $5K promissory note | Debt on property | Minimal |
| Bank accounts | Likely minimal | — | ~$0 |
| Vehicles | Depreciated value | Any loans | Minimal |
| **Total Net Asset Equity** | | | **~$0-$5,000 est.** |

**Estimated RCP = ~$0 (assets) + ($0 x 12) = $0 to ~$5,000**

### What This Means

With a $0 or near-$0 RCP, you could potentially settle $140K for **pennies on the dollar** — potentially as low as $205 (the application fee) to a few thousand dollars.

### Low-Income Certification

If your AGI is at or below **250% of federal poverty guidelines** (~$38,250 for a single person in 2025), the $205 application fee is WAIVED and you don't have to make monthly payments while OIC is being evaluated.

Your AGI is ~$10,800/year ($900 x 12 — VA disability is NOT included in AGI). You qualify.

### OIC Forms Required

| Form | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Form 656 | Offer in Compromise application |
| Form 433-A (OIC) | Collection Information Statement for Individuals |
| Form 656-L | Low-income certification (waives $205 fee) |

### OIC Timeline

- Processing: 6-12 months (sometimes longer)
- While pending: IRS suspends collection AND your debt is not "seriously delinquent" = **PASSPORT DECERTIFIED**
- If accepted: Debt is settled for the agreed amount
- If rejected: You can appeal

### OIC Compliance Requirements

- Must be current on all tax filings (file all missing returns FIRST)
- Must stay current on estimated tax payments for 5 years after acceptance
- Must remain compliant for 5 years or the full original debt is reinstated

---

## 6. CURRENTLY NOT COLLECTIBLE (CNC)

### How to Qualify

Your monthly income must be **less than** IRS-allowed monthly expenses. As shown above:

- Income: $4,400
- IRS Allowable Expenses: $4,533
- **You qualify.** Your expenses exceed your income by $133/month.

### How to Request

1. Call IRS Collections: 1-800-829-1040 (or the number on your notice)
2. Request CNC / hardship status
3. IRS may ask you to complete **Form 433-F** (Collection Information Statement)
4. Provide documentation: pay stubs, bank statements, rent/mortgage proof, utility bills

### What CNC Does

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Stops all collection activity | No levies, no garnishments |
| **Decertifies passport** | IRS must reverse 7345 certification within 30 days |
| Interest/penalties still accrue | Debt doesn't go away, it just grows |
| Annual review | IRS checks your income periodically (usually annually) |
| CSED still runs | The 10-year clock keeps ticking = debt can expire |
| Tax refunds seized | IRS will still take any refunds |

### CNC as a Bridge Strategy

CNC is the **fastest way** to get the passport back if you need it soon:
1. Call IRS, provide financial info showing hardship
2. Get CNC status (can happen in a single phone call)
3. IRS decertifies within 30 days
4. Passport restored ~2-3 weeks after decertification
5. **Total time: ~6-8 weeks**

Then you can separately pursue amended returns + OIC for the long game.

---

## 7. INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT

### Does It Decertify Passport?

**YES.** Entering an IRS-approved installment agreement triggers decertification within 30 days.

### Types of Installment Agreements

| Type | Debt Amount | Requirements |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Guaranteed | $10,000 or less | Auto-approved, no financial disclosure |
| Streamlined | $50,000 or less | Minimal paperwork, pay within 72 months |
| Non-streamlined | Over $50,000 | Requires Form 433-A/F, full financial disclosure |
| Partial-pay (PPIA) | Any amount | Pay what you can; remainder expires at CSED |

### Your Situation: $140K = Non-Streamlined Required

- Must file Form 9465 + Form 433-F or 433-A
- IRS will calculate payment based on your disposable income
- With disposable income at $0 or negative, the IRS would likely:
  - Place you in CNC instead, OR
  - Set a very low payment amount (partial-pay installment agreement)

### Minimum Payment

Standard formula: debt / 72 months = $140,000 / 72 = ~$1,944/month. You **cannot** afford this.

With financial hardship documented: IRS can accept a partial-pay installment agreement (PPIA) at whatever your actual disposable income is — potentially $0-$100/month.

### Low-Income Taxpayer Fee Waiver

If AGI is at/below 250% of poverty level, the user fee ($22-$225 depending on type) is waived or reimbursed.

---

## 8. CSED — STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

### The Rule

IRS has **10 years** from the date of assessment to collect. After the CSED, the debt is legally unenforceable and must be written off.

### How to Find Your Assessment Dates

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **IRS Account Transcript** | Request online at IRS.gov/account or mail Form 4506-T |
| **Notice of Federal Tax Lien** | Assessment date is listed on the lien document |
| **Call IRS** | 1-800-829-1040 — ask for assessment dates for each tax year |
| **Freedom of Information** | Form 4506 for exact return processing dates |

### What Extends the CSED (Tolling Events)

| Event | How Long CSED Pauses |
|-------|---------------------|
| OIC pending + 30 days | Full time OIC is being considered |
| Installment agreement request + 30 days | While pending |
| CDP hearing | While pending |
| Bankruptcy + 6 months | Full time in bankruptcy |
| Taxpayer outside US for 6+ consecutive months | Time abroad |
| Innocent spouse relief request | While pending |
| Lawsuit by IRS to collect | While pending |
| Military combat zone service | While deployed + 180 days |

### CSED Strategy for Your $140K

- If any of your tax years were assessed 7-8+ years ago, those debts are approaching expiration
- **DO NOT** take actions that toll the CSED unless the benefit outweighs the cost
- An OIC tolls the CSED — if rejected, you've lost that time
- CNC does NOT toll the CSED — this is why CNC is strategically valuable
- **Get your transcripts FIRST** to calculate exact CSED dates for each year

### CSED Example

| Tax Year | Filed/Assessed | CSED Expires |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| 2015 | April 2016 (est.) | April 2026 |
| 2016 | April 2017 (est.) | April 2027 |
| 2017 | April 2018 (est.) | April 2028 |
| 2018 | April 2019 (est.) | April 2029 |

**If any of the $140K is from 2015 or earlier, those amounts may expire THIS YEAR.**

---

## 9. PENALTY ABATEMENT

### First-Time Abatement (FTA)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Filing compliance | Filed (or had valid extensions) for 3 years prior to the penalty year |
| Payment compliance | Paid all taxes due or are in an approved payment arrangement |
| Clean penalty history | No penalties of the same type for 3 prior years |
| **Starting 2026** | FTA will be applied automatically by the IRS |

### Eligible Penalties for FTA

- Failure to file (up to 25% of tax due)
- Failure to pay (up to 25% of tax due)
- Failure to deposit (employment tax)

### Reasonable Cause Abatement

If FTA doesn't apply, you can request abatement for "reasonable cause":

| Accepted Reasons | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|
| Serious illness | Documented medical condition |
| Natural disaster | FEMA-declared disaster area |
| Death in family | Close family member |
| Unable to get records | Fire, flood, etc. |
| Bad advice from IRS | Documented in writing |
| Military deployment | Active duty service |
| Reliance on tax professional | Must show reasonable reliance |

### How to Request

- **By phone:** Call 1-800-829-1040 for FTA
- **By mail:** Write to IRS at the address on your notice; include tax year, penalty type, reason, supporting docs
- **Form 843:** Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement (for formal written requests)

### Potential Penalty Reduction on $140K

Penalties can represent 20-40% of total IRS debt. If $140K includes $30K-$50K in penalties, successful abatement could reduce the debt significantly — potentially below the $66K passport threshold.

---

## 10. TAX COURT FILING

### How It Works as a Passport Strategy

Under IRC 7345(e), you can file a civil action in **Tax Court** or **U.S. District Court** to:
1. Challenge that the certification was **erroneous**
2. Challenge that the IRS **failed to reverse** a certification it should have reversed

### Key Case: Garcia v. Commissioner (2025)

- Tax Court ruled that the standard of review is **de novo** (full fresh look)
- Taxpayers get a **full evidentiary hearing**, not just review of IRS administrative record
- This gives you the opportunity to present evidence the IRS may have overlooked

### Tax Court Rules 350-354

These are the specific rules governing passport certification suits. Filing fee is $60.

### Strategy Value

Filing a Tax Court petition:
- Forces the IRS to engage on the merits
- Creates leverage for negotiation
- The filing itself may trigger a review of your account
- Does NOT automatically decertify the passport, but creates a path to judicial relief
- Combined with filing amended returns showing reduced liability, this is powerful

### When to Use This

- If the IRS refuses to reverse certification after you've entered an installment agreement, OIC, or CNC
- If you believe the certification was erroneous (wrong amount, wrong taxpayer, procedural errors)
- As a pressure tactic to force the IRS to the negotiating table

---

## 11. CONGRESSIONAL HELP

### How It Works

Every Member of Congress has a **casework office** that helps constituents with federal agency problems, including the IRS. This is free.

### Process

1. Contact your U.S. Representative's district office (based on your address)
   - **Your address:** 6595 Roswell Road, G2919, Atlanta, GA 30328
   - Find your rep at: house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative
2. Also contact both Georgia U.S. Senators' offices
3. Ask for the **caseworker who handles IRS/tax issues**
4. Sign a **Privacy Release Form** (allows them to contact IRS on your behalf)
5. They will submit a **Congressional Inquiry** to the IRS

### What It Does

- IRS has an internal **Congressional Affairs Program** (IRM 13.1.8) that fast-tracks congressional inquiries
- Your case gets assigned to a senior IRS employee
- The IRS must respond to the congressional office within a set timeframe
- A congressman CANNOT tell the IRS what to decide, but can force them to actually process your case and explain their position

### When to Use This

- If the IRS is ignoring you or processing is stalled
- If you've been waiting months for amended return processing
- If you can't get through to IRS by phone
- If you need urgency on passport decertification
- **Veteran status** gives additional weight — mention USMC service

### Also Contact: Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Form | Form 911 — Request for Taxpayer Advocate Service Assistance |
| Phone | 1-877-777-4778 |
| Email | TAS.Form.911.Request.for.Assistance@irs.gov |
| Response time | 30 days |
| When to use | IRS is causing you economic harm, you can't resolve through normal channels, passport revocation is causing hardship |

---

## 12. RECOMMENDED ACTION SEQUENCE

### PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE (Weeks 1-2) — Get the Passport Back

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Request IRS Account Transcripts** for ALL years with balances. Use IRS.gov online account or Form 4506-T. Get exact assessment dates for CSED calculation. | Day 1 |
| 2 | **Call IRS Collections (1-800-829-1040).** Request CNC (Currently Not Collectible) hardship status. Your income ($4,400) is below IRS allowable expenses ($4,533). Have bank statements and income docs ready. | Day 1-3 |
| 3 | **File Form 911** with Taxpayer Advocate Service. Explain passport revocation is causing hardship. Mention veteran status. Request expedited processing. | Day 3 |
| 4 | **Contact Congressman's office.** Sign privacy release. Ask caseworker to push IRS on CNC status and passport decertification. | Day 5 |
| 5 | Wait for CNC approval and passport decertification. | 4-8 weeks |

### PHASE 2: REDUCE THE DEBT (Weeks 2-8) — Amended Returns

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 6 | **Hire a CPA/EA who specializes in real estate** (not a regular tax preparer). You need someone who understands Schedule C, Schedule E, cost segregation, and amended returns. | Week 2 |
| 7 | **Gather all records:** Bank statements, closing statements (HUDs), 1099s, contractor invoices, marketing receipts, software subscriptions, mileage logs, insurance policies, mortgage statements, property tax bills. Everything from every year. | Weeks 2-4 |
| 8 | **File Form 1040-X for each applicable year.** Priority: years with largest balances. Claim ALL deductions from Section 4 above. Even without receipts, the CPA can reconstruct reasonable estimates using bank records. | Weeks 4-8 |
| 9 | **Request penalty abatement** (FTA and/or reasonable cause) for each year. File Form 843 or call. | Concurrent with Step 8 |

### PHASE 3: SETTLE OR WAIT (Months 3-6) — Strategic Decision

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 10 | **Calculate revised balance** after amended returns reduce liability and penalties are abated. | Month 3 |
| 11 | **Check CSED dates.** If any years expire within 1-2 years, DO NOT file OIC (it tolls the clock). Let those debts expire. | Month 3 |
| 12 | **Decision point:** If remaining balance is still high and CSED is far out, file Offer in Compromise. With $0 disposable income, your offer could be $0-$5,000 on whatever remains. | Month 3-4 |
| 13 | **File OIC** (Forms 656, 433-A OIC, 656-L for fee waiver). This also keeps the passport decertified while pending. | Month 4 |
| 14 | If OIC is rejected, appeal. If appeal fails, enter partial-pay installment agreement. | Month 6-12 |

### PHASE 4: LONG GAME — Let Time Work

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 15 | Stay in CNC or low-payment installment agreement. | Ongoing |
| 16 | CSED clock keeps running. Debt expires year by year. | 10 years from each assessment |
| 17 | File all future returns on time. Pay estimated taxes. Stay compliant. | Ongoing — forever |
| 18 | If income increases significantly, revisit strategy (IRS will review CNC annually). | As needed |

## BOTTOM LINE

Your situation is not as bad as it looks. Here's why:

1. **You never claimed deductions.** Filing amended returns with proper RE investor write-offs could reduce the $140K by 30-60% or more.
2. **Your income is below IRS allowable expenses.** You qualify for CNC immediately, which gets the passport back.
3. **Your OIC math works.** $0 disposable income = potential settlement for pennies on the dollar.
4. **Time is on your side.** Every year that passes, the CSED eats away at the debt.
5. **VA disability is tax-free.** Your $3,500/mo is protected from IRS levy (mostly), and your AGI is extremely low, qualifying you for fee waivers.

**The IRS agent was right.** File those amended returns. But do CNC first to get the passport back NOW.
