## THE GOLDEN RULE OF SELLER COMMUNICATION
You are NOT a salesperson. You are a PROBLEM SOLVER.
You are NOT buying a house. You are HELPING a family move forward.
Every word you choose either builds trust or destroys it.

## WORDS THAT KILL DEALS vs. WORDS THAT CLOSE DEALS

### NEVER SAY → SAY INSTEAD

| ❌ NEVER SAY | ✅ SAY INSTEAD | WHY |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| "Sell" / "Selling" | "Move forward" / "Part with" / "Let go of" | "Sell" feels transactional and cold. "Move forward" feels like progress. |
| "Buy" / "Buying" | "Take over" / "Help with" / "Work something out" | "Buy" positions you as a predator. "Help" positions you as a partner. |
| "Home" | "Property" / "House" | "Home" is emotional — it's where they raised their kids. "Property" is an asset. Detach emotion from the transaction. |
| "Contract" / "Legal" | "Paperwork" / "Agreement" / "Simple document" | Legal language triggers fear and suspicion. Keep it casual. |
| "Sign" | "Approve" / "Authorize" / "Put your OK on" | "Sign" feels permanent and scary. "Approve" feels empowering. |
| "I want to buy your house" | "Would you or the family be interested in entertaining an offer on the property?" | Vague, non-threatening, opens dialogue without pressure. |
| "What's your bottom dollar?" | "If we could work something out, what would you need to walk away feeling good?" | Focuses on their emotional satisfaction, not your price extraction. |
| "I'll give you [price]" | "Based on the condition and the market, I could probably be somewhere around [price]" | "Probably" and "somewhere around" leave room to negotiate without anchoring too hard. |
| "Motivated seller" (to their face) | "Someone in a tough situation" / "Going through a transition" | Never let a seller feel like prey. They're people with problems. |
| "Deal" / "Transaction" | "Situation" / "Arrangement" / "Solution" | "Deal" feels like you're winning and they're losing. |
| "Distressed property" | "Property that needs some love" / "Fixer" / "Property with some deferred maintenance" | Don't insult their property to their face. |
| "Wholesaler" / "Investor" | "I work in real estate" / "I help families with properties" | Labels create walls. Be a person, not a category. |
| "Earnest money" / "Deposit" | "Good faith amount" / "Small commitment to show I'm serious" | Removes the legal sting from financial terms. |
| "Closing" | "Wrapping everything up" / "Getting this taken care of" | Makes the end feel simple, not like a court proceeding. |
| "Inspection" / "Due diligence" | "I just want to take a closer look" / "Walk through it" | Technical terms alienate. Keep it neighbor-to-neighbor. |
| "Assignment" | "I work with a group of buyers" / "I may bring in a partner" | Don't explain wholesaling mechanics to sellers. It confuses and scares them. |
| "How much do you owe?" | "Is there a mortgage on the property?" → then "Do you have a rough idea of what's left on it?" | Asking what someone owes feels invasive. Ease into it. |
| "What's wrong with it?" | "Tell me about the condition — anything you'd want to update if you had unlimited money?" | Makes them comfortable disclosing issues without feeling judged. |
| "Are you behind on payments?" | "Is everything current on the property, or has it been tough keeping up?" | Softens the shame of financial difficulty. |
| "I need to..." | "Would it be OK if I..." | Asking permission builds trust and makes sellers feel in control. |
| "You have to..." | "What a lot of folks in your situation do is..." | Removes direct pressure. Social proof normalizes the action. |

## THE 4 PILLARS OF PRE-QUALIFYING (Brent Daniels TTP Framework)

Every conversation must uncover these 4 things. Without all 4, you can't make a real offer.

### PILLAR 1: CONDITION
"Tell me about the property — what kind of shape is it in?"
- Get SPECIFIC: roof, HVAC, foundation, kitchen, baths, flooring
- Ask: "If you had unlimited money, what would you update?"
- Ask: "Has anything been done to it recently, or has it been a while?"
- The worse the condition → the more motivated → the deeper your discount

### PILLAR 2: TIMELINE
"Is there a timeline you're working with?"
- Short timeline (< 30 days) = HOT lead
- Medium timeline (1-3 months) = Warm lead — nurture
- Long timeline (6+ months) = Cold lead — drip campaign
- Key follow-up: "What happens if you DON'T get this taken care of by [their date]?"
- This question reveals the CONSEQUENCE, which is the real motivator

### PILLAR 3: MOTIVATION
"If you don't mind me asking, what's going on with the property that made you think about letting it go?"
- LISTEN. Do NOT interrupt. Let silence work for you.
- The deeper the pain, the more flexible they'll be on price
- Common motivations: foreclosure, divorce, death in family, job loss, relocation, tired landlord, inherited and don't want it, tax liens, code violations, health issues, hoarding
- When they share something painful, respond with empathy FIRST:
  "Man, I'm really sorry to hear that. That sounds incredibly stressful."
  Then wait. Let THEM keep talking.

### PILLAR 4: PRICE
"If we could work something out, what would you need to walk away feeling good about this?"
- ALWAYS let the seller say the number first (anchoring)
- If they say a number below your MAO → great, agree quickly
- If they say a number at/near your MAO → negotiate gently
- If they say a number way above → DON'T counter yet. Say:
  "I appreciate that. Help me understand how you arrived at that number."
  Then educate them on condition, repairs, market, your costs
- NEVER say "that's too high" → say "I'm not sure I can get there, but let me see what I can do"

## PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES FOR CLOSING

### 1. RECIPROCITY — Give Before You Ask
- Lead with value: "I pulled some comps on your property just to get an idea..."
- Offer something helpful: "Whether you work with me or not, here's what I'd suggest..."
- When you give first, sellers feel compelled to give back (their time, their deal)

### 2. SOCIAL PROOF — You're Not the First
- "A lot of homeowners in your situation do exactly this..."
- "I just helped a family over on [street] — similar situation..."
- "What most people in this position find is..."
- Normalizes their decision. They're not the weird one for selling to an investor.

### 3. LOSS AVERSION — People Fear Losing More Than They Desire Gaining
- "What happens if you don't take care of this in the next [timeline]?"
- "The longer it sits, the more the taxes, insurance, and maintenance add up..."
- "I'd hate for you to miss this window and have to deal with [consequence]..."
- Frame your offer as PREVENTING LOSS, not as a gain for you

### 4. ANCHORING — First Number Wins
- Always let the seller say a number first
- If forced to go first, anchor with data: "Properties in this condition, in this area, are trading around [low range]..."
- Present your offer AFTER establishing the cost of repairs, market conditions, and their timeline pressure

### 5. CONTRAST PRINCIPLE — Make Your Offer Look Good by Comparison
- "If you listed on the MLS, you'd pay 6% commissions, wait 60-90 days, do repairs, have showings, deal with inspections, negotiate repairs again, and hope the buyer's financing doesn't fall through. OR... I can take care of everything in 14 days, as-is, no commissions, no hassle."
- Paint the PAIN of the alternative before presenting your offer

### 6. SCARCITY & URGENCY — Without Being Manipulative
- "I can only take on a few properties at a time, so I want to make sure we can get this locked up soon if we're both on the same page."
- "My lending situation / my buyer's situation is favorable right now, but I can't guarantee it'll stay that way."
- Real urgency, not fake pressure

### 7. SILENCE — The Most Powerful Negotiation Tool
- After you state your offer: SHUT UP
- The first person to speak after an offer loses negotiating leverage
- Let the silence do the work. The seller will fill the void.
- If they counter, pause again before responding. Don't rush.
- Silence communicates confidence and seriousness

### 8. THE TAKEAWAY — Be Willing to Walk
- "Look, I don't want to waste your time. If this doesn't make sense for you, I totally understand. No hard feelings."
- This REMOVES pressure, which paradoxically makes them MORE likely to accept
- If you're desperate, they smell it. If you're indifferent, they chase you.
- ALWAYS be willing to walk away — and make sure they know it

### 9. FUTURE PACING — Help Them See Life After
- "Imagine 30 days from now, this is completely off your plate. No more mortgage, no more maintenance, no more stress. How does that feel?"
- Help them VISUALIZE the relief
- "Once we wrap this up, what are you going to do? Move closer to family? Downsize? Travel?"
- Get them emotionally invested in the OUTCOME, not the transaction

### 10. LABELING EMOTIONS (FBI Negotiation Technique)
- "It sounds like this has been really stressful for you..."
- "It seems like you've been carrying this weight for a while..."
- "It feels like you're ready to move on but just need the right situation..."
- Labeling someone's emotions makes them feel HEARD and builds deep trust instantly
- From Chris Voss (Never Split the Difference) — start with "It sounds like..." / "It seems like..."

## OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### "I'm not interested"
"I totally get that. Most people I talk to say the same thing at first. Can I just ask — is it that you're not interested in an offer at all, or is it more about the timing right now?"
(This separates a TRUE no from a reflexive brush-off)

### "I'm not ready yet"
"That's completely fine. I'm not in any rush either. Can I ask — is there something you're waiting on, or is it more that you just haven't found the right situation?"
(This uncovers the REAL blocker)

### "I need to think about it"
"Absolutely, take your time. What specifically are you weighing? I might be able to help you think through it."
(This keeps the conversation open and identifies the objection behind the objection)

### "Your offer is too low"
"I hear you. Help me understand what you were hoping for, and I'll see if there's a way to bridge the gap. Sometimes we can get creative with the terms to make the numbers work."
(Opens door for seller finance, sub-to, or adjusted closing timeline instead of just price)

### "I want to talk to my spouse / family / attorney"
"Of course, you should absolutely involve them. Would it be helpful if I put together a simple summary of what we talked about so you can share it with them? And would [day] be a good time for us to reconnect?"
(Supports their process, gives them a tool to advocate for you, and sets the follow-up)

### "I want to list it with an agent"
"That's definitely an option. Have you thought about what the net would be after commissions, repairs the buyer might ask for, and the 60-90 days on market? I only ask because sometimes when people do the math, working with someone like me actually puts more in their pocket — faster."
(Don't bash agents — just help them do the math)

### "I don't want to give it away"
"I would never want you to feel that way. My goal is to find a number that's fair for both of us. Can you walk me through what 'fair' looks like to you?"
(This validates their concern and opens the door to find their real number)

### "I already have another offer"
"That's great! I'm glad you're exploring your options. Would it be OK if I still put something together for you? That way you can compare and make the best decision for your family."
(Don't compete — just ask to be an option)

### "How did you get my number?"
"Good question — I use a research service that helps me find homeowners who might be open to an offer on their property. I'm not trying to be intrusive at all. If this isn't something you're interested in, I'm happy to take you off my list."
(Honest, transparent, gives them control)

## RAPPORT BUILDING TECHNIQUES

### At the Door / On the Phone
1. **Mirror their energy** — If they're calm, be calm. If they're energetic, match it.
2. **Use their name** — People love hearing their own name. Use it naturally 2-3 times.
3. **Find common ground** — Kids, pets, neighborhood, sports, weather. 60 seconds of small talk before business.
4. **Compliment something genuine** — Their yard, their neighborhood, something in the house. NOT the property condition.
5. **Physical matching** — At the property, sit if they sit. Stand if they stand. Don't tower over a seated seller.
6. **Slow down** — Talk slower than you normally do. Fast talking = salesperson. Slow = trusted advisor.
7. **Tonality** — Drop your voice slightly at the end of sentences. This conveys authority and calm. Upward inflection = uncertainty.

### At the Property (The Appointment)
1. **Walk the property WITH them** — Don't inspect alone. Walk together. Ask THEM to point out issues.
2. **Let them tell the stories** — "What room was your favorite?" This is emotional release. Let it happen.
3. **Take notes in front of them** — Shows you're serious and listening.
4. **Don't badmouth the property** — Even if it's a disaster. Say: "This has a lot of character" or "I can see the potential here."
5. **Ask about the neighborhood** — "What do you like about this area?" This gets them talking positively, which builds rapport.
6. **Sit at the kitchen table** — If possible, sit down with them. Standing feels confrontational. Kitchen table feels like family.
7. **Bring water or coffee** — A small gesture that shows you're not in a rush and you care.

### The TTP Mindset
- Talk to people like a NEIGHBOR, not a salesperson
- Your job is to ask questions and LISTEN — they should talk 70%, you talk 30%
- Be genuinely curious about their situation
- If you can't help them, say so. Honesty builds reputation and referrals.
- Never pressure, never rush, never manipulate
- The deal should feel like THEIR idea, not yours

## CLOSING TECHNIQUES

### The Assumptive Close
"Great, so it sounds like we're on the same page. I'll have the paperwork drawn up and we can get this wrapped up this week. Does Tuesday or Thursday work better for you?"
(Assume the deal is done. Don't ask IF — ask WHEN)

### The Summary Close
"So just to make sure I've got this right — you need [amount], you want to be done by [date], and you'd like to leave the [items] behind. I can do all of that. Let's go ahead and get this taken care of."
(Repeat their terms back, then close)

### The Puppy Dog Close
"Tell you what — let me put the paperwork together and you can look it over. There's no obligation. If you like what you see, great. If not, no hard feelings. Sound fair?"
(Low pressure. Let the paperwork do the selling)

### The Either/Or Close
"Would you prefer to close in 14 days or would 30 days give you more time to get settled?"
(Both options = a close. They're choosing between YES and YES)

### The "What Would It Take?" Close
"I hear you that we're not quite there on price. What would it take for us to shake hands today?"
(Puts the ball in their court and shows flexibility)

### The Ben Franklin Close
"Why don't we list out the pros and cons together? On one side, you keep the property and continue dealing with [their pain]. On the other side, you move forward, get [their desired outcome], and this is off your plate in [timeline]."
(Logic + emotion = decision)

## CLAUDE: WHEN HELPING ME DRAFT COMMUNICATIONS OR SCRIPTS

Always apply these psychology rules:
- Use SOFT language (property not home, paperwork not contract, etc.)
- Lead with empathy, not price
- Frame everything as HELPING the seller, not buying from them
- Ask questions that uncover the 4 Pillars (condition, timeline, motivation, price)
- Never sound scripted — conversational, neighbor-to-neighbor tone
- Use labeling ("It sounds like...") and silence
- Always give the seller a feeling of CONTROL in the process
- Position me as a problem solver, not a buyer
- When writing scripts, texts, emails, or mail — NEVER use hard legal or financial terms
- Default to the soft language table above for ALL seller-facing communications
