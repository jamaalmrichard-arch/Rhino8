## 1. VA Math: What You Actually Need

### How VA Math Works

The VA does NOT add ratings. It uses "combined ratings" based on remaining efficiency.

**Formula:** Each new rating is applied to the REMAINING healthy percentage, not the total.

### The Math From 90%

At 90%, the VA says you have **10% remaining efficiency** (100% - 90% = 10%).

To reach 100% schedular, your combined rating must hit **95% or higher** (rounds up to 100%).

| Additional Rating Needed | Calculation | Combined Result | Rounds To |
|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 10% | 10% of 10% = 1% | 91% | **90%** (no change) |
| 20% | 20% of 10% = 2% | 92% | **90%** (no change) |
| 30% | 30% of 10% = 3% | 93% | **90%** (no change) |
| 40% | 40% of 10% = 4% | 94% | **90%** (no change) |
| **50%** | 50% of 10% = 5% | **95%** | **100%** |
| 60% | 60% of 10% = 6% | 96% | **100%** |
| 70% | 70% of 10% = 7% | 97% | **100%** |

**Bottom line:** You need at least ONE additional 50% rating on top of your existing 90% to reach 100% schedular. A 40% addition leaves you at 94% which rounds DOWN to 90%. This is a hard cliff.

### Alternate Path: Multiple Smaller Ratings

Multiple smaller ratings can combine to reach the same result:

| Scenario | Combined New Rating | Applied to 10% | Total | Rounds To |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| 30% + 30% | Combined = 51% | 5.1% | 95.1% | **100%** |
| 30% + 20% | Combined = 44% | 4.4% | 94.4% | **90%** |
| 20% + 20% + 20% | Combined = 49% | 4.9% | 94.9% | **90%** |
| 30% + 20% + 10% | Combined = 50% | 5.0% | 95.0% | **100%** |

**Key insight:** Two 30% ratings or a combination equaling 50%+ in new ratings will get you there.

### Bilateral Factor Bonus

If you have disabilities affecting BOTH sides of paired body parts (both knees, both shoulders, etc.), the VA adds 10% of the combined bilateral value before combining with other ratings. This can push you over the edge.

---

## 2. TDIU: The Alternate Route to 100%

TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) pays at the **100% rate** even if your combined rating is less than 100%. This is the most common way veterans bridge from 90% to 100% pay.

### Eligibility Criteria

**Schedular TDIU (standard):**
- ONE disability rated at 60% or higher, OR
- Combined rating of 70%+ with at least one disability at 40%+
- At 90% combined, you almost certainly meet the rating threshold

**Extraschedular TDIU (38 CFR 4.16b):**
- Does not meet schedular criteria but still cannot work
- Referred to the Director of Compensation Service
- Harder to get, but available

### How to Apply

1. **VA Form 21-8940** - Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability
2. **VA Form 21-4192** - Request for Employment Information (sent to former employers)

### What "Substantial Gainful Employment" Means

- Full-time employment producing income ABOVE the federal poverty level
- **2026 Federal Poverty Level:** $15,960/year for individual ($1,330/month)
- Marginal employment (part-time, odd jobs, sheltered work) does NOT disqualify you
- **Passive income (rental income, investments, dividends) does NOT count against TDIU**
- Self-employment is evaluated by the TYPE and FREQUENCY of work, not just income

### Critical TDIU Consideration for Real Estate

- **Passive rental income** (collecting rent checks, hiring a property manager) = ALLOWED
- **Active property management** (doing repairs, managing tenants yourself) = RISKY
- **Wholesaling** (actively working deals) = likely considered substantial gainful employment
- **Strategy:** Use property managers, LLCs, and passive structures. Keep earned income below poverty level.

### TDIU Strengths at 90%

- You already exceed the 70% combined threshold
- If ANY single condition is rated 40%+, you meet schedular criteria
- Combat veteran status carries weight with VA adjudicators
- Mental health conditions (PTSD) are strong TDIU anchors because they affect ALL types of employment

---

## 3. Conditions That Bridge 90-100%

### Tier 1: High-Value Claims (30-50% ratings each)

**Sleep Apnea (50% with CPAP)**
- Rated at 0%, 30%, 50%, or 100% under DC 6847
- CPAP use = automatic 50% rating CURRENTLY
- **WARNING:** VA has proposed rule changes for 2026 that may eliminate automatic 50% for CPAP alone
- **ACTION:** File NOW before rule change takes effect. Grandfathering applies to ratings obtained before the change.
- Secondary to PTSD is one of the most common and well-supported connections
- Requires: sleep study diagnosis + nexus letter linking to service-connected condition

**Migraines (30% or 50%)**
- 30% = prostrating attacks averaging once per month
- 50% = very frequent, completely prostrating, prolonged attacks causing severe economic inadaptability
- "Prostrating" = so severe you must stop all activity and lie down
- Secondary to PTSD, TBI, or chronic pain conditions
- Track frequency in a headache log (dates, duration, severity, what you had to stop doing)

**PTSD Increase (if currently below 70%)**
- 50% = occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity
- 70% = deficiencies in most areas (work, family, judgment, thinking, mood)
- 100% = total occupational and social impairment
- If currently rated 50% for PTSD, increasing to 70% can significantly move the combined rating

**Depression/Anxiety (secondary to chronic pain or other conditions)**
- Rated at 0-100% under General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders
- Can be secondary to tinnitus, chronic pain, or any service-connected condition causing significant life impact
- NOTE: VA uses the "pyramiding" rule -- you cannot get separate ratings for PTSD AND depression if they share the same symptoms. But if depression is claimed secondary to a PHYSICAL condition (not PTSD), it may be rated separately.

### Tier 2: Moderate-Value Claims (10-30%)

**Tinnitus (10% max for tinnitus itself)**
- Capped at 10% regardless of severity
- BUT secondary conditions to tinnitus can add significantly:
  - Depression secondary to tinnitus (10-100%)
  - Anxiety secondary to tinnitus (10-100%)
  - Sleep disturbance secondary to tinnitus (0-100%)
  - Meniere's disease (30-100%)

**GERD/Acid Reflux (10-60%)**
- Secondary to PTSD medications (SSRIs, pain meds)
- Secondary to chronic pain medication use
- 10% = mild symptoms
- 30% = persistently recurrent symptoms with considerable impairment of health
- 60% = severe symptoms with material weight loss, hematemesis, melena

**Erectile Dysfunction (0% + Special Monthly Compensation)**
- Typically rated 0% BUT qualifies for SMC-K ($131.44/mo additional tax-free in 2026)
- Secondary to PTSD medications, diabetes, or hypertension
- Low bar to prove -- medication side effects are well-documented

**Hypertension (0-60%)**
- Secondary to PTSD (documented medical literature supports this)
- 10% = diastolic pressure predominantly 100+ or systolic 160+, requiring continuous medication
- Requires current diagnosis and nexus

### Tier 3: Supporting Claims

**Radiculopathy** (if back/neck conditions exist) - 10-60% per extremity
**Peripheral neuropathy** - 10-40% per extremity
**Scars** (painful or unstable) - 10-20%
**Limited range of motion** increases on existing orthopedic conditions

---

## 4. Secondary Service Connection Claims

### What They Are

A secondary condition is a NEW disability caused or AGGRAVATED by an existing service-connected condition. You do NOT need to prove it happened in service -- only that your already-rated condition caused or worsened it.

### Legal Standard

38 CFR 3.310: "Disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall be service connected."

Two types:
1. **Causation** - The service-connected condition CAUSED the new condition
2. **Aggravation** - The service-connected condition WORSENED a pre-existing condition

### How to Establish Nexus

1. Current diagnosis of the secondary condition (medical records)
2. Existing service-connected condition (already rated by VA)
3. Medical nexus evidence linking #1 to #2 (nexus letter)
4. Supporting medical literature showing the connection is medically plausible

### Most Common Secondary Claim Chains

| Primary Condition | Common Secondary Conditions |
|---|---|
| PTSD | Sleep apnea, migraines, hypertension, GERD, erectile dysfunction, depression, substance abuse disorders |
| Chronic Back Pain | Radiculopathy, depression, sleep disturbance, gait abnormality, hip/knee problems |
| Tinnitus | Depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, Meniere's disease |
| Knee/Ankle Injury | Opposite knee/ankle (overcompensation), hip condition, back condition, gait issues |
| Diabetes | Peripheral neuropathy, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, vision problems |
| Medications (for any SC condition) | GERD, liver issues, erectile dysfunction, weight gain |

### Filing Secondary Claims

- Use **VA Form 21-526EZ** (same as original claims)
- Select "new" condition and note it is secondary to [existing condition]
- Include nexus letter and supporting medical evidence
- File Intent to File (21-0966) FIRST to lock effective date

---

## 5. Nexus Letters

### What They Must Say

A winning nexus letter contains FOUR mandatory elements:

1. **Provider Credentials** - Full name, license type, specialty, years of experience. A cardiologist writing about a heart condition carries more weight than a general practitioner.

2. **Records Review Statement** - "I have reviewed the veteran's complete service treatment records, VA medical records, and relevant medical history including [list specific records reviewed]."

3. **Nexus Opinion** - Must use the EXACT language: **"It is at least as likely as not (50% or greater probability)"** that [condition] is caused by / aggravated by [service-connected condition or military service].

4. **Medical Rationale** - The WHY. This is where most letters fail. Must include:
   - Specific medical reasoning connecting the conditions
   - Reference to peer-reviewed medical literature/studies
   - Explanation of how the veteran's specific case fits the medical evidence
   - Discussion of any alternative causes and why they are less likely

### Key Language to Include

- "At least as likely as not" (this is the VA's standard of proof -- 50/50 or better)
- "Based on my clinical experience and review of current medical literature..."
- "The veteran's [condition] is proximately due to / aggravated by..."
- Reference to specific studies (especially for PTSD-sleep apnea, PTSD-hypertension connections)

### Key Language to AVOID

- "Possible" or "might be" (too speculative)
- "Cannot determine without resorting to speculation" (this is a denial trigger)
- "May be related" (not strong enough)

### Who Should Write Them

**Private doctors (PREFERRED):**
- Choose specialists relevant to the condition (psychiatrist for mental health, pulmonologist for sleep apnea)
- They can take time to write a thorough, well-reasoned letter
- You control the process and can review before submission

**VA doctors:**
- Can write nexus letters but often won't (time constraints, institutional reluctance)
- Their opinions carry weight because they are "treating physicians"
- Ask your VA provider directly -- some will do it

### Cost

| Provider | Approximate Cost | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Telemedica | $1,000 - $2,000 | Nationwide telehealth, 20,000+ veterans served, DBQs available |
| MRPY Professional Services | $650+ ($100 per additional condition) | Veteran-owned, free claim review |
| VetNexusMD | $800 - $1,500 | Online, telehealth |
| Local specialist | $500 - $3,000 | In-person, can vary widely |
| Free (VA doctor) | $0 | If willing; no guarantee of favorable opinion |

### Cost-Saving Strategy

Get a **free nexus letter** from your VA treating physician first. If they decline or write a weak one, then pay for a private nexus letter. Some providers offer free claim reviews before you commit.

## 6. C&P Exam Preparation

### What C&P Exams Are

Compensation & Pension exams are medical evaluations ordered by the VA to assess the severity of your claimed conditions. The examiner fills out a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) that directly determines your rating.

### Before the Exam

**Gather and review:**
- Your entire claims file (request via VA.gov)
- All medical records related to claimed conditions
- List of all medications with dosages
- List of all symptoms with frequency and severity
- Personal statement describing worst days
- Buddy statements (see Section 12)

**Prepare a "worst day" summary:**
- How often does the condition flare?
- What can you NOT do during flares?
- How does it affect work, relationships, daily activities?
- What treatments have you tried that did not work?

### During the Exam: What to Do

1. **Describe your WORST days, not your best.** The VA rates on average severity, but the examiner needs to understand the full range.
2. **Be specific.** Not "my back hurts" but "I get sharp, shooting pain down my left leg that forces me to lie down for 2-3 hours, happening 4 times per week."
3. **Quantify everything.** Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly), duration (minutes, hours), intensity (1-10 scale).
4. **Describe functional impact.** "I cannot sit longer than 20 minutes." "I miss 3-4 days of activity per month." "I cannot bend to tie my shoes."
5. **Mention ALL secondary effects.** Depression from pain, sleep loss from anxiety, relationship strain.
6. **Bring documentation.** Medical records, buddy statements, headache logs, sleep logs.
7. **Stay calm and professional.** The examiner is not your enemy but they are evaluating you.

### During the Exam: What NOT to Do

1. **Do NOT say "I'm fine" or "I'm doing okay."** This gets written down verbatim and used against you.
2. **Do NOT minimize symptoms.** Marine toughness works in combat, not at C&P exams. Do not push through pain demonstrations -- if it hurts, SAY SO.
3. **Do NOT exaggerate.** Examiners are trained to spot inconsistencies. Exaggeration destroys credibility for your entire claim.
4. **Do NOT say "I can still do X on good days."** Focus on limitations, not capabilities.
5. **Do NOT rush.** Take your time answering. Ask for clarification if needed.
6. **Do NOT leave things out.** If you forgot to mention something, call the examiner's office afterward or submit a statement.
7. **Do NOT discuss unrelated topics.** Stay focused on the claimed conditions.
8. **Do NOT argue with the examiner.** If you disagree with their assessment, challenge it through the appeals process.

### How DBQs Work

DBQs (Disability Benefits Questionnaires) are standardized forms the examiner fills out. They contain:
- Diagnosis confirmation
- Symptom severity checkboxes
- Functional impact assessments
- Range of motion measurements (orthopedic)
- Nexus opinion (for new claims)

**You can download the relevant DBQ from VA.gov BEFORE your exam** to see exactly what the examiner will evaluate. This tells you precisely what symptoms and measurements matter for your rating level.

Public DBQs available at: https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_publicdbqs.asp

### After the Exam

- Request a copy of the completed DBQ
- If you believe the exam was inadequate, request a new exam through your VSO
- You have the right to dispute findings through the appeals process

---

## 7. Intent to File (VA Form 21-0966)

### What It Does

Filing an Intent to File locks your **effective date** for up to ONE YEAR. This means if your claim is approved, back pay starts from the Intent to File date, not the date you submitted your full claim.

### Why It Matters Financially

If 100% is approved and your Intent to File was 12 months before the decision:
- Back pay = ($3,939 - $2,362) x 12 months = **$18,924 in retroactive payment**

### How to File

Three options:
1. **Online:** VA.gov > File a disability claim > Start Intent to File
2. **Phone:** Call VA at 1-800-827-1000 and request an Intent to File
3. **Paper:** Submit VA Form 21-0966 by mail

### Timeline

- Takes effect immediately upon receipt
- You have exactly **1 year** to submit your full claim (VA Form 21-526EZ)
- If you miss the 1-year window, the effective date reverts to whenever you actually file

### Strategy

**FILE YOUR INTENT TO FILE TODAY.** Right now. Before reading the rest of this document. It costs nothing, takes 5 minutes, and locks in your effective date while you build your evidence package.

## 8. Appeals: Supplemental vs HLR vs Board

### When Each Path Makes Sense

| Review Type | When to Use | New Evidence? | Timeline | Form |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Supplemental Claim** | You have NEW evidence the VA hasn't seen (new nexus letter, new diagnosis, new medical records) | YES, required | ~68 days avg | VA Form 20-0995 |
| **Higher Level Review (HLR)** | VA made an error with EXISTING evidence (wrong rating criteria, overlooked evidence, miscalculated) | NO new evidence allowed | ~125 days avg | VA Form 20-0996 |
| **Board Appeal** | Complex case, need a judge to weigh evidence, or both above options failed | Yes (Evidence/Hearing dockets) or No (Direct Review) | 506-713 days avg | VA Form 10182 |

### Decision Framework

```
Claim Denied or Underrated?
    |
    +--> Do you have NEW evidence (nexus letter, medical records, diagnosis)?
    |       |
    |       YES --> File SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM (Form 20-0995)
    |       |
    |       NO --> Did the VA make a clear ERROR with existing evidence?
    |               |
    |               YES --> File HIGHER LEVEL REVIEW (Form 20-0996)
    |               |       (Request informal conference -- 67% of HLRs with
    |               |        conferences result in favorable outcomes)
    |               |
    |               NO --> File BOARD APPEAL (Form 10182)
    |                       Choose: Direct Review, Evidence, or Hearing docket
```

### Deadlines

- **Supplemental Claim:** No deadline (can file anytime with new evidence)
- **Higher Level Review:** 1 year from decision date
- **Board Appeal:** 1 year from decision date

### Pro Tips

- You can file a Supplemental Claim AFTER a failed HLR (as long as you have new evidence)
- You can file MULTIPLE Supplemental Claims for the same condition
- If your HLR results in a "duty to assist" error, it gets sent back for a new exam -- this is GOOD
- Board Appeals take the longest but Veterans Law Judges can grant what regional offices won't

## 9. 100% Schedular vs 100% P&T

### Key Differences

| Feature | 100% Schedular | 100% P&T |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly compensation | Same (~$3,939 alone) | Same (~$3,939 alone) |
| Subject to re-examination | YES | NO |
| Can be reduced | YES | NO (except fraud) |
| ChampVA for dependents | NO | **YES** |
| DEA Chapter 35 (education) | NO | **YES** |
| Property tax exemption | Varies by state | **YES (most states)** |
| Space-A travel | Limited | **YES (Cat 6)** |
| Commissary/Exchange access | YES | YES |
| Free dental (Class IV) | YES | YES |
| State benefits | Partial | **FULL** |

### P&T Additional Benefits Breakdown

**ChampVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the VA)**
- Health insurance for spouse and dependents
- Covers most healthcare, prescriptions, mental health
- No monthly premium (small copays only)
- This alone is worth $5,000-$15,000/year in health insurance savings

**DEA Chapter 35 (Dependents' Educational Assistance)**
- Monthly stipend for spouse and children to attend college
- 2025-2026 rate: $1,574/month full-time
- Children eligible ages 18-26
- Spouse has 10-year window from P&T effective date
- Total value: up to $75,000+ per dependent

**Georgia Property Tax Exemption**
- Up to $121,812 exemption on homestead (2025 amount, indexed annually)
- Exemption from ALL ad valorem taxation: state, county, municipal, and school
- Surviving spouse and minor children also eligible
- Must apply through county tax assessor

**Additional Georgia Benefits at 100%**
- Free Georgia driver's license/ID
- Free vehicle registration (one vehicle)
- Exempt from TAVT (title ad valorem tax)
- Toll-free driving on GA roads (with disabled veteran plate)
- Discounted state park access
- Discounted hunting/fishing licenses

**Space-A Travel**
- Fly on military aircraft when seats are available (Category 6)
- Covers CONUS and international flights
- Essentially free air travel (just pay taxes/fees)

**How to Verify P&T Status**
Your decision letter will reference:
- "Permanent and Total"
- "No future examinations scheduled"
- "Dependents Educational Assistance" or "Chapter 35"
- Check on VA.gov > Disability > View your rated disabilities

### How to Get P&T

- P&T is granted when the VA determines your conditions are **static** (unlikely to improve)
- Conditions rated for 5+ years are more likely to be considered static
- Conditions rated for 20+ years cannot be reduced below the lowest rating held
- Mental health conditions (PTSD) are commonly granted P&T if chronic and treatment-resistant
- Age is a factor -- older veterans are more likely to receive P&T
- You can request P&T upgrade if currently 100% schedular

## 10. Timeline Expectations

| Action | Expected Timeline |
|---|---|
| Intent to File (21-0966) | Same day (online/phone) |
| Gather medical evidence | 2-8 weeks |
| Obtain nexus letters | 2-6 weeks |
| Submit claim (21-526EZ) | Day of completion |
| C&P exam scheduled | 2-4 weeks after submission |
| Initial claim decision | ~85 days average |

**Average case:** 4-6 months
**Worst case (appeal required):** 12-36 months

**TDIU timeline:** Similar to increase claims, 4-6 months average

---

## 11. VSO Role

### What a VSO Can Do

- File claims on your behalf
- Access your claims file (VBMS) in real-time
- Track claim status and development
- Prepare and submit evidence
- Represent you at informal conferences (HLR)
- Represent you before the Board of Veterans' Appeals
- Help identify conditions you may not have claimed
- Review C&P exam results and advise on adequacy
- **All of this is FREE**

### What a VSO Cannot Do

- Charge you money (prohibited by law)
- Guarantee outcomes
- Provide medical opinions or write nexus letters
- Practice law (they are not attorneys)
- Make decisions for you
- Access your file at the chapter/post level (only accredited VSOs at regional/national level)

### Best VSOs for Combat Veterans

| Organization | Strengths | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **DAV (Disabled American Veterans)** | Specializes in disability claims, 1,300+ chapters, strong training program | Best overall for disability claims |
| **VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars)** | Largest war vet org, strong advocacy, combat veteran focus | Must have served in a combat zone |
| **American Legion** | Wide network, general benefits assistance | Largest overall VSO |
| **IAVA (Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America)** | Modern, tech-savvy, understands post-9/11 issues | Newer org, strong peer support |
| **Wounded Warrior Project** | Focus on severely wounded, mental health programs | Not a traditional VSO but strong support |

### Recommendation

Contact the **DAV** at your local VA Regional Office in Atlanta. Request an accredited VSO representative (not a chapter volunteer). They handle the most disability claims and have the deepest training.

Alternatively, if your claim is complex or denied, consider a **VA-accredited attorney**. They can only charge if they win, and fees are typically 20-33% of back pay.

## 12. Buddy Statements

### What They Are

Written statements from people who have firsthand knowledge of your condition and its impact. Filed on **VA Form 21-10210** (Lay/Witness Statement).

### Who Should Provide Them

**Best sources:**
1. **Girlfriend (Braela)** - Can describe: sleep disturbances, mood changes, social withdrawal, pain episodes, daily limitations she witnesses
2. **Fellow Marines** - Can describe: in-service incidents, conditions during service, changes they observed in you
3. **Close friends (Eric Clavo)** - Can describe: behavioral changes over time, social limitations, observed symptoms
4. **Family members** - Can describe: impact on family life, daily limitations
5. **Former coworkers/business partners** - Can describe: occupational impairment, missed work, performance issues

### How to Write a Buddy Statement

**Structure (4 sections):**

1. **Introduction:** Full name, contact information, relationship to veteran, how long you have known them, how frequently you interact

2. **In-Service Knowledge (if applicable):** What you witnessed during military service, specific incidents, conditions

3. **Current Observations:** Specific symptoms you observe, frequency, severity, impact on daily life. BE SPECIFIC:
   - BAD: "He seems stressed a lot"
   - GOOD: "At least 3-4 times per week, I notice Jamaal is unable to sleep through the night. He wakes up sweating and agitated. On these mornings, he is irritable, withdrawn, and unable to focus on tasks for several hours."

4. **Functional Impact:** How the condition affects their ability to work, maintain relationships, perform daily activities, and enjoy life

### Key Rules

- **Specific > vague.** Dates, frequencies, examples.
- **Honest > dramatic.** No exaggeration. No emotional appeals.
- **Firsthand only.** Only describe what YOU have personally witnessed.
- **Quality > quantity.** 2-3 strong statements beat 10 weak ones.
- **Each statement should be 1-2 pages.** Focused and detailed.

### Submission

- Upload with claim on VA.gov
- Submit via mail to VA regional office
- Give to your VSO for inclusion in claims file

## 13. TDIU and Real Estate Income

### Critical Distinction for Jamaal's Situation

**Passive income = ALLOWED on TDIU.** There is NO limit on passive income.
**Earned income = Must stay below poverty level ($15,960/year in 2026).**

### What Counts as Passive vs Earned (Real Estate)

| Activity | Classification | TDIU Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Collecting rent from tenants (property manager handles everything) | PASSIVE | No impact |
| Dividends, interest, investment returns | PASSIVE | No impact |
| Wholesaling deals (active negotiation, marketing, deal-making) | EARNED | Could disqualify |
| Flipping houses (active project management, contractor oversight) | EARNED | Could disqualify |
| Being a landlord (taking repair calls, showing units, maintenance) | EARNED | Could disqualify |

### Strategy If Pursuing TDIU

1. Hire a property management company for all rental properties
2. Use LLC structures -- do not be the active manager
3. Keep all "active" real estate income below poverty level
4. Document that any earned income is marginal/part-time
5. Consult a VA-accredited attorney about your specific RE activities before filing

### Alternative: 100% Schedular (No Income Restrictions)

If you can reach 100% schedular through combined ratings, there are **ZERO income restrictions**. You can wholesale, flip, buy, sell, manage -- no limits. This is the preferred route if your conditions support it.

## 15. Decision Tree

### Step 1: Determine Current Condition Breakdown

Before filing, you need to know your CURRENT rated conditions and percentages. Pull your rating decision letter from VA.gov.

### Step 2: Choose Your Path

```
CURRENT SITUATION: 90% Combined
    |
    +--> Can you identify a NEW or WORSENED condition worth 50%+?
    |       |
    |       YES --> Path A: File for increase/new claim to reach 100% SCHEDULAR
    |       |       (Sleep apnea = 50%, PTSD increase, migraines = 50%)
    |       |
    |       NO --> Can you identify MULTIPLE conditions worth 30%+ combined?
    |               |
    |               YES --> Path A: File for multiple increases/new claims
    |               |
    |               NO --> Path B: File for TDIU
    |
    +--> Are your service-connected conditions preventing you from working?
            |
            YES --> Path B: File for TDIU (pays at 100% rate)
            |       Even if also pursuing Path A
            |
            NO --> Path A is your only option. Build evidence for new/increased ratings.
```

### Path A: 100% Schedular (Preferred -- no income restrictions)

**If you have PTSD rated below 70%:**
- File for PTSD increase with updated treatment records
- Get nexus letter from psychiatrist documenting worsening
- Prepare buddy statements about behavioral/social impact

**If you DO NOT have sleep apnea rated:**
- Get a sleep study (VA or private)
- If diagnosed, get nexus letter linking to PTSD or service
- FILE BEFORE 2026 RULE CHANGE to lock in 50% CPAP rating

**If you have chronic pain conditions:**
- File secondary claims: depression, radiculopathy, sleep disturbance
- Each 10-30% rating chips away at that remaining 10% efficiency

**If you have tinnitus at 10%:**
- File secondary: depression/anxiety secondary to tinnitus (separate from PTSD if possible)
- File secondary: sleep disturbance secondary to tinnitus

### Path B: TDIU

**If you have ONE condition at 40%+:**
- File VA Form 21-8940
- Document inability to maintain substantially gainful employment
- Get statement from vocational expert or treating physician
- Show work history gaps and failed employment attempts

**If filing TDIU with real estate activities:**
- Hire property manager BEFORE filing
- Restructure all active RE work through LLCs/employees
- Keep personal earned income below $15,960/year
- Document that any work is marginal/part-time

### Path C: Both Simultaneously

**You can file for BOTH increased ratings AND TDIU at the same time.** This is the recommended approach:
- If increased ratings get you to 100% schedular, TDIU becomes moot (no income restrictions)
- If increased ratings don't reach 100%, TDIU provides the 100% pay rate
- Either way, you win

## 16. Concrete Action Plan

### PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE (This Week)

**Day 1 (TODAY):**
- [ ] **File Intent to File (VA Form 21-0966)** online at VA.gov or call 1-800-827-1000
  - This locks your effective date. Every day you wait is money lost.
  - Takes 5 minutes. Do it NOW.

- [ ] **Pull your current rating decision letter** from VA.gov
  - Go to VA.gov > Disability > View your rated disabilities
  - Document every condition and its current percentage
  - Identify which conditions are underrated or missing

**Day 2-3:**
- [ ] **Contact DAV at Atlanta VA Regional Office**
  - Request an accredited VSO representative
  - Atlanta VARO: 1700 Clairmont Road, Decatur, GA 30033
  - Phone: 1-800-827-1000 (ask for DAV representative)
  - Bring your rating decision letter

- [ ] **Request your complete C-file** from VA
  - Online: VA.gov > Records > Request your military records
  - Or: Submit FOIA request for claims file
  - This takes 2-4 weeks but your VSO can access VBMS immediately

### PHASE 2: EVIDENCE BUILDING (Weeks 1-4)

**Medical Evidence:**
- [ ] **Schedule sleep study** (if not already diagnosed with sleep apnea)
  - Request through VA primary care OR get private sleep study
  - If CPAP is prescribed, this is a likely 50% rating
  - URGENCY: File before 2026 rule change eliminates automatic 50% for CPAP

- [ ] **Schedule mental health evaluation** (if PTSD not at 70%+)
  - Request updated evaluation through VA mental health
  - Be completely honest about symptoms -- worst days, not best days
  - Document: sleep disturbance, hypervigilance, nightmares, social withdrawal, irritability, concentration problems

- [ ] **Document migraine history** (if applicable)
  - Start a daily headache log: date, time, duration, severity (1-10), whether prostrating (had to stop all activity), triggers
  - Need to show pattern of prostrating attacks for 30% (monthly) or 50% (frequent + prolonged)

- [ ] **Review all medications** for side effects that could be secondary claims
  - PTSD meds causing GI issues = GERD secondary claim
  - Any medication causing erectile dysfunction = SMC-K claim
  - Pain meds causing sleep problems, GI issues, etc.

**Nexus Letters:**
- [ ] **Ask VA treating physicians first** (free)
  - Request nexus opinion for each secondary condition
  - If they agree to write one, review it before submission

- [ ] **If VA doctors decline, contact private nexus letter providers:**
  - Telemedica: https://telemedica.com (nationwide telehealth)
  - MRPY Professional Services: https://www.mrpyprofessionalservices.com (veteran-owned)
  - Budget: $650-$2,000 per letter depending on provider and complexity
  - Prioritize: sleep apnea nexus (highest value at 50%)

**Buddy Statements:**
- [ ] **Request buddy statements from:**
  - Braela Banks (daily observations of symptoms, sleep, mood)
  - Eric Clavo (long-term behavioral changes, social limitations)
  - Any fellow Marines (in-service observations)
  - Family members (impact on daily life)
  - Use VA Form 21-10210
  - Coach them on being specific: dates, frequencies, examples

### PHASE 3: FILING (Weeks 4-8)

- [ ] **Compile evidence package:**
  - All nexus letters
  - All buddy statements
  - All medical records
  - Headache log / symptom logs
  - Personal statement describing daily limitations

- [ ] **File claims on VA.gov (Form 21-526EZ):**
  - File for ALL identified conditions simultaneously
  - Include: increases on existing conditions + new secondary conditions + TDIU (if applicable)
  - Upload all evidence as attachments
  - Select "Fully Developed Claim" if all evidence is ready

- [ ] **If also filing TDIU:**
  - Submit VA Form 21-8940 (Unemployability)
  - Submit VA Form 21-4192 to former employers
  - Include statement about inability to maintain substantially gainful employment

### PHASE 4: C&P EXAMS (Weeks 6-12)

- [ ] **Prepare for each exam:**
  - Download relevant DBQ from VA.gov
  - Review what the examiner will evaluate
  - Prepare your "worst day" summary
  - Bring all documentation
  - Do NOT take pain medication before orthopedic exams (show true limitations)
  - DO take normal medications before mental health exams (they want to see you on treatment)

- [ ] **After each exam:**
  - Request copy of completed DBQ
  - Review for accuracy
  - If exam was inadequate, notify your VSO immediately

### PHASE 5: DECISION & FOLLOW-UP (Weeks 12-24)

- [ ] **If APPROVED at 100%:**
  - Verify P&T status on decision letter
  - If NOT P&T, request upgrade or wait for stabilization (5+ years)
  - Apply for Georgia property tax exemption
  - Apply for ChampVA (if P&T)
  - Apply for DEA Chapter 35 (if P&T)
  - Get disabled veteran license plate

- [ ] **If DENIED or UNDERRATED:**
  - Review decision letter with VSO
  - Determine error type:
    - New evidence available? --> Supplemental Claim (Form 20-0995)
    - VA made error with existing evidence? --> Higher Level Review (Form 20-0996)
    - Complex case needing judge? --> Board Appeal (Form 10182)
  - File within 1 year of decision date
  - Consider hiring VA-accredited attorney for appeals

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **File Intent to File TODAY.** Not tomorrow. Today. It is free and locks your effective date.
2. **Sleep apnea is the #1 priority claim.** 50% rating + CPAP. File before 2026 rule change.
3. **File TDIU simultaneously** with increase/secondary claims. Belt and suspenders.
4. **100% schedular is better than TDIU** for you because of real estate activities. No income restrictions.
5. **VA doctors can write nexus letters for free.** Ask before paying $1,500.
6. **Buddy statements from Braela and Eric** are your strongest lay evidence. Coach them on specifics.
7. **Download the DBQ for every claimed condition** before your C&P exam. Know what the examiner is scoring.
8. **Georgia P&T benefits alone** (property tax exemption, ChampVA, DEA, free registration) are worth $20,000+/year on top of the monthly compensation increase.
9. **Do not discuss your real estate activities at C&P exams** unless directly asked about employment. If asked, describe limitations honestly.
10. **Passive rental income does not affect TDIU.** But active management does. Structure accordingly.
