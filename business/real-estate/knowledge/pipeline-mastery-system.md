## THE PIPELINE MASTERY WORKFLOW

### PHASE 1: DATA & LIST BUILDING (PropStream)
1. Log into PropStream
2. Pull targeted lists using filters:
   - **Pre-Foreclosure** — highest motivation
   - **Tax Delinquent** — 1+ years behind
   - **Probate / Inherited** — heirs don't want property
   - **Absentee Owners** — out-of-state, non-owner occupied
   - **High Equity (70%+)** — room for assignment fee
   - **Vacant Properties** — mail returned, no occupant
   - **Code Violations** — tired owners
   - **Divorce Filings** — need fast resolution
   - **Liens** — IRS, mechanic's, judgment
   - **Expired/Withdrawn MLS** — couldn't sell traditionally
3. List stack for maximum motivation (properties appearing on 2+ lists = GOLD)
4. Export lists as CSV with: Owner Name, Property Address, Mailing Address, Owner Type

### PHASE 2: SKIP TRACING (DataZapp)
1. Upload PropStream CSV to DataZapp
2. Append: Cell Phones + Emails (minimum)
3. Download enriched list (~minutes turnaround)
4. Output: Owner Name, Property Address, Mailing Address, Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3, Email 1, Email 2

### PHASE 3: CRM IMPORT & PIPELINE SETUP (Zoho CRM)

**Import enriched list into Zoho CRM**

**Lead Stages (Pipeline):**
```
1. NEW LEAD          → Just imported, not yet contacted
2. CONTACT ATTEMPTED → Tried to reach, no answer yet
3. CONTACTED         → Spoke with owner
4. QUALIFIED         → Motivated + has equity + timeline
5. APPOINTMENT SET   → Property visit scheduled
6. APPOINTMENT MET   → Property visited, numbers run
7. OFFER MADE        → Verbal or written offer presented
8. UNDER CONTRACT    → Signed PSA
9. IN DISPOSITION    → Finding buyer (wholesale) or closing prep
10. CLOSED           → Deal done, paid
11. DEAD LEAD        → Not motivated / no deal possible
12. NURTURE          → Not ready now, follow up in 30/60/90 days
```

**Lead Scoring (in Zoho):**
| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| On pre-foreclosure list | +20 |
| On tax delinquent list | +15 |
| On 2+ lists (stacked) | +25 |
| Absentee/out-of-state | +10 |
| Vacant property | +15 |
| Probate/inherited | +20 |
| High equity (70%+) | +10 |
| Answered phone | +10 |
| Expressed motivation verbally | +30 |
| Has timeline (< 90 days) | +20 |
| Willing to discuss price | +15 |

**Hot Lead = 60+ points → Immediate priority**

---

## THE 13-TOUCH FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

### Philosophy
- Most deals close on touch 5-12, NOT touch 1
- 80% of wholesalers quit after touch 2-3 — that's where your money is
- Multi-channel = impossible to ignore (call + text + RVM + email + mail)
- Every touch has a PURPOSE and a different ANGLE
- Spread across 8 weeks minimum
- After 13 touches, move to Nurture (monthly touch) or Dead

### The 13 Touches

```
TOUCH  DAY   CHANNEL         PURPOSE / MESSAGE ANGLE
─────  ────  ──────────────  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  1     1    📞 COLD CALL    Initial contact. Build rapport. Qualify.
                              "Calling about your property at [address]..."
                              Disposition: Interested → Stage 3+ | No answer → continue sequence

  2     1    📱 TEXT (SMS)    Immediate follow-up (same day, after call attempt)
                              "Hi [Name], I just tried calling about your
                              property at [Address]. I'm a local investor
                              and may be interested in making you an offer.
                              Is this a good number to reach you? — [Your Name]"

  3     3    📩 RVM DROP      Ringless voicemail via Just Deliver It
                              Friendly, casual, personal tone:
                              "Hey [Name], this is [You], local real estate

                              I buy houses in the area and thought I'd reach out.
                              No pressure, just curious if you've ever thought
                              about selling. Give me a call back at [number]."

  4     5    📧 EMAIL #1      Value-first email. Don't sell yet.

                              Body: Introduce yourself, mention you're local,
                              ask if they've considered selling. Short,
                              personal, NOT salesy.

  5     7    📞 CALL #2       Second call attempt. Different time of day.
                              If answered: deeper qualifying conversation.
                              If VM: leave live voicemail (different from RVM).
                              "Following up from last week..."

  6    10    📱 TEXT #2        Curiosity / urgency angle

                              at [Address]. I have a few cash buyers looking

                              a no-obligation offer? — [Your Name]"

  7    14    📮 DIRECT MAIL   Physical mail piece — postcard or yellow letter
              (POSTCARD)       Handwritten-style preferred. Stand out in mailbox.
                              "Dear [Name], I'm interested in buying your

                              Call or text me: [Number] — [Your Name]"

  8    17    📩 RVM DROP #2   Different script — social proof angle

                              down the street from yours last month. Still

 10    25    📞 CALL #3       Third call attempt. Get direct — ask about
                              their situation. Offer to come see the property.
                              "I know I've reached out a few times. I don't
                              want to be a pest, but I am seriously interested..."

 11    30    📱 TEXT #3        Breakup angle (creates urgency)
                              "Hey [Name], I've been trying to connect about
                              [Address]. I don't want to keep bothering you.

                              But if you ever want a no-hassle cash offer,
                              I'm just a text away. — [Your Name]"

 12    40    📮 DIRECT MAIL   Second mail piece — different format
              (LETTER)         Use a #10 envelope with handwritten font or
                              actual handwritten yellow letter.
                              Different message than postcard. More personal.
                              "I noticed your property has been [vacant/in
                              pre-foreclosure/etc]. I'd love to help..."

 13    55    📧 EMAIL #3      Final email — "door is always open"
                              Subject: "Last note from me (for now)"
                              Body: Warm, professional, zero pressure.
                              "I'll stop reaching out for now, but my offer
                              stands. If anything changes — job, family,
                              finances — I'm here to help. No judgment,
                              no pressure. Just call or text [Number]."
```

### After 13 Touches
- **If no response:** Move to NURTURE stage → 1 touch per month (rotating: text, RVM, mail)
- **If responded but not ready:** Move to NURTURE → monthly check-in, personalized
- **If responded and motivated:** Move to QUALIFIED → appointment → offer → contract
- **If "do not contact":** Mark DNC immediately, remove from all campaigns, document in CRM
