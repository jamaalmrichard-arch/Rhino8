## DEAL ANALYSIS

### Using Mid-Range Numbers

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Purchase Price | $155,000 (negotiate from ask) |
| Renovation | $185,000 (mid, Jamaal GCs) |
| Closing Costs (buy) | $5,000 |
| Holding Costs (6 mo @ ~$1,500/mo) | $9,000 |
| **ALL-IN** | **$354,000** |

### ARV (After Repair Value)

| Method | Calculation | ARV |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| $/sqft (conservative $230) | 1,350 sqft × $230 | $310,500 |
| $/sqft (market median $241) | 1,350 sqft × $241 | $325,350 |
| $/sqft (premium comp $254) | 1,350 sqft × $254 | $342,900 |
| Comp-based (Grove Park renovated) | Comparable sales range | $310,000 - $360,000 |
| **Garage premium** | +$15,000-$25,000 over non-garage comps | Added above |

**Estimated ARV: $325,000 - $360,000**

Using $340,000 midpoint:

## EXIT STRATEGIES

### AS A FLIP

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| ARV | $340,000 |
| All-In Cost | $354,000 |
| Realtor Commission (6%) | -$20,400 |
| Seller Closing Costs | -$5,000 |
| Net Proceeds | $314,600 |
| **Net Profit** | **-$39,400** |
| ROI | **NEGATIVE** |

**FLIP VERDICT: ❌ FAIL** — At mid-range renovation costs, this LOSES money as a flip. The renovation scope (addition + garage) is too expensive relative to the ARV in this market. Grove Park comps don't support $400K+ yet.

**To make a flip work, you'd need:**
- Purchase at $120,000 or below
- Renovation capped at $130,000 (tight)
- OR: No garage, no addition — just a gut reno of existing 984sf to a clean 2/1 and sell at $220-$250K range

### AS A HOME FOR TIA (Primary Residence)

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Purchase + Reno All-In | $354,000 |
| ARV | $340,000 |
| Instant Equity | -$14,000 (slightly underwater) |
| BUT: No realtor commission | Saves $20,400 |
| Owner-occupant financing (FHA 3.5%) | Down: ~$5,425 |
| 203(k) Renovation Loan option | Wraps purchase + reno into 1 mortgage |
| Monthly PITI (est. $340K @ 6.5%, 30yr) | ~$2,600/mo |

**HOME VERDICT: ⚠️ POSSIBLE BUT TIGHT** — This works as a home for Tia if:
1. You negotiate purchase to $130K-$140K
2. Keep renovation at $150K-$170K (skip the 2-car garage, do 1-car)
3. Use a 203(k) loan to wrap everything together
4. Total mortgage: $280K-$310K
5. Monthly payment: ~$2,100-$2,300

### AS A BRRRR (Buy, Renovate, Rent, Refinance, Repeat)

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| All-In Cost | $354,000 |
| ARV | $340,000 |
| Refi at 75% LTV | $255,000 |
| Capital Left In | $99,000 |
| Market Rent (renovated 3/2.5 w/ garage) | $2,200-$2,600/mo |
| Monthly Expenses (PITI + PM + reserves) | ~$2,000/mo |
| Cash Flow | $200-$600/mo |
| CoC Return on $99K left in | 2.4% - 7.3% |

**BRRRR VERDICT: ❌ FAIL** — Too much capital left in. The addition/garage pushes all-in costs above what the refi covers.

---

## BOTTOM LINE

### The Honest Truth

This property works as **a home for Tia at a negotiated price** — NOT as a flip or BRRRR. The 0.34-acre lot and Grove Park location are great fundamentals, but the math doesn't support a full addition + garage at current market values.

### How to Make This Work

| Strategy | What to Do |
|----------|-----------|
| **Best case** | Negotiate to $130K-$140K. Use FHA 203(k) reno loan. Keep reno at $150K-$170K. Skip 2-car garage (do 1-car at $15K). Total mortgage: $285K-$310K. Tia gets a beautiful 3/2.5 home worth $325K+ in a gentrifying neighborhood. |
| **Scale back** | Skip the garage entirely. Do the master suite addition + gut reno only. Saves $30K-$40K. All-in: $290K-$320K. ARV: $300K-$325K (without garage). |
| **Wait for appreciation** | Grove Park is down 10-14% right now. If you buy at the dip and hold 3-5 years, the BeltLine expansion and Westside Park proximity could push values to $400K+. This is a long-term play. |

### The 0.34-Acre Lot Is the Real Asset

Most Grove Park lots are 0.15-0.20 acres. This one is nearly DOUBLE the average. That's:
- Room for the addition without cramping
- Room for a garage
- Room for future ADU (accessory dwelling unit) if Atlanta zoning allows
- Higher land value as the area gentrifies
- Potential lot split in the future

The lot alone may be worth $60K-$80K in 5 years as Westside development continues.

## REVISED SCENARIO — Fix & Flip Loan → Permanent Refi

### The Play
1. Buy at a negotiated price ($120K-$135K)
2. Fund with fix-and-flip loan (hard money / bridge)
3. Renovate at $150K budget (Jamaal GCs, tight subs)
4. Permanent refi into Tia's name (conventional) or LLC (DSCR)
5. Tia lives in it OR rent it out

### Fix & Flip Loan (Acquisition + Rehab)

| Detail | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Purchase Price (negotiated) | $125,000 |
| Renovation Budget | $150,000 |
| All-In Before Closing/Holding | $275,000 |
| Closing Costs (buy side) | $4,000 |
| HML Points (2 pts on $275K) | $5,500 |
| Holding Costs (6 mo × $2,300 interest-only) | $13,800 |
| **Total All-In** | **$298,300** |

HML assumptions: 90% LTV on purchase, 100% rehab, 12% rate, 2 points, 12-month term.

### ARV After Renovation

| Scenario | ARV |
|----------|-----|
| Conservative ($230/sqft × 1,350sf) | $310,500 |
| Mid ($241/sqft × 1,350sf) | $325,350 |
| Strong ($254/sqft × 1,350sf) | $342,900 |
| **Working ARV** | **$335,000** |

---

### REFI OPTION 1: Conventional Refi — Tia's Personal Name (Owner-Occupant)

Tia has good credit. Owner-occupant gets the best rates and highest LTV.

| Detail | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| ARV | $335,000 |
| LTV | 80% (owner-occupant) |
| New Loan Amount | $268,000 |
| Rate (est. 6.5%) | 6.5% |
| Monthly P&I | $1,694 |
| Property Tax (~1.1% Atlanta) | $307 |
| Insurance | $150 |
| **Total Monthly PITI** | **$2,151** |
| | |
| Capital to pay off HML | $268,000 |
| Total All-In Cost | $298,300 |
| **Capital Left In Deal** | **$30,300** |

**Tia walks into a $335K home with only $30K out of pocket.** That $30K is instant equity — the house is worth $335K and she owes $268K = **$67,000 in equity day one.**

If she can get 85% LTV (some conventional programs allow this with PMI):
- Loan: $284,750
- Capital left in: $13,550
- Nearly all capital recovered

### REFI OPTION 2: DSCR Loan — LLC (Investment Property)

If you want to keep it in an LLC and rent it out instead:

| Detail | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| ARV | $335,000 |
| LTV | 75% (DSCR standard) |
| New Loan Amount | $251,250 |
| Rate (est. 7.5% DSCR) | 7.5% |
| Monthly P&I | $1,757 |
| Property Tax | $307 |
| Insurance | $165 |
| Property Management (8%) | $192 |
| Maintenance Reserve (5%) | $120 |
| Vacancy (8%) | $192 |
| **Total Monthly Expenses** | **$2,733** |
| | |
| Market Rent (3/2.5 w/ garage, renovated) | $2,400 |
| **Monthly Cash Flow** | **-$333** |
| | |
| Capital Left In Deal | $47,050 |

**DSCR as rental: ❌ NEGATIVE CASH FLOW.** Rent doesn't cover the nut at 7.5%. DSCR lender may not approve since DSCR ratio = 0.88 (need 1.0+ minimum).

**DSCR works ONLY if:**
- ARV appraises at $360K+ (loan = $270K, lower capital left in)
- Rent hits $2,700+ (possible in 2-3 years as area appreciates)
- Rate drops to 6.5% (if market rates decrease)

### REFI OPTION 3: Conventional Refi — Tia's Personal Name (Rental/Investment)

Non-owner-occupant conventional in Tia's name (if she has a slot open out of her 10 conventional):

| Detail | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| ARV | $335,000 |
| LTV | 75% (investment conventional) |
| New Loan Amount | $251,250 |
| Rate (est. 7.0%) | 7.0% |
| Monthly P&I | $1,671 |
| Property Tax | $307 |
| Insurance | $165 |
| PM (8%) | $192 |
| Maintenance (5%) | $120 |
| Vacancy (8%) | $192 |

### VERDICT: BEST PATH

| Option | Capital Left In | Monthly Cost | Cash Flow | Verdict |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Tia lives in it (80% LTV)** | **$30,300** | **$2,151/mo** | N/A (personal) | ✅ BEST |
| Tia lives in it (85% LTV w/ PMI) | $13,550 | $2,300/mo | N/A (personal) | ✅ GREAT |
| DSCR in LLC (rental) | $47,050 | $2,733/mo | -$333/mo | ❌ |
| Conventional investment (rental) | $47,050 | $2,647/mo | -$247/mo | ❌ |

### THE PLAY: Fix & Flip Loan → Owner-Occupant Refi in Tia's Name

1. **You buy at $125K** with a fix-and-flip loan (HML or bridge)
2. **You GC the renovation** — $150K budget, 5-6 months
3. **Tia refinances into her name** at 80% LTV owner-occupant conventional
4. **You get $268K back** — only $30K left in the deal
5. **Tia has a $335K home** with $67K equity, paying $2,151/mo
6. **In 3-5 years** the BeltLine/Westside appreciation could push this to $400K-$450K
