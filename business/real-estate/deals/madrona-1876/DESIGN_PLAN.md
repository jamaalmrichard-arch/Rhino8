## DESIGN VISION: "Dark Modern Ranch"

**Concept:** Moody, modern exterior with warm interior contrast. Dark exterior hides defects and ages well. Natural wood warms the entry points. Inside: open concept living, rental-durable finishes, blue/white kitchen as the hero room.

**Target Tenant:** Young professional or small family, $1,800-2,200/mo rent range. Westside Atlanta near Beltline. They want Instagram-worthy kitchen + modern bathrooms.

## EXTERIOR — "Stealth Mode"

### Paint
- **Body:** Sherwin-Williams "Iron Ore" (SW 7069) or "Tricorn Black" (SW 6258) — near-black charcoal

- **Front door:** Bold accent — deep navy or matte black with brushed brass hardware
- **Budget:** $2,500 (in SOW)

### Porches — Natural Wood Contrast
- **Front porch:** Sand existing wood, seal with natural wood tone stain (Behr "Cordovan Brown" or "Cedar Naturaltone"). Repair damaged floor boards.
- **Rear deck:** Demo existing (in SOW). Build new deck with pressure-treated lumber, stain to match front porch.
- **Railings:** Simple black metal or cable rail — modern, cheap, durable
- **Budget:** $3,500 (in SOW for demo + new deck + front porch repair)

### Roof + Gutters
- **Roof:** Architectural shingles, charcoal/black to match exterior
- **Gutters:** Black seamless aluminum
- **Budget:** $5,000 (in SOW)

### Siding/Fascia/Soffit

- **Budget:** $2,000 (in SOW)

- **Budget:** $250 (in SOW)

**Exterior subtotal: $15,750**

---

## INTERIOR — Open Concept Living

### Wall Removal: Kitchen/Dining
- Remove wall between kitchen and dining room (in SOW)
- Creates open sightline from front door through living → dining → kitchen
- If load-bearing: LVL beam with 2 posts or a clean header. Budget $500-1,500 extra if needed.
- Verify with contractor before demo

### Flooring Strategy (Budget-Smart)
- **Downstairs:** LVP throughout (living, dining, kitchen, hallways) — waterproof, pet-proof, rental-proof
  - Recommendation: LifeProof "Sterling Oak" or "Trail Oak" from Home Depot — $2.69/sf, looks like real wood
  - Warm medium-tone to contrast dark exterior
- **Upstairs bedrooms:** Carpet — builder grade is fine for rentals
  - Recommendation: Neutral gray or warm beige, stain-resistant
- **Refinish existing hardwoods** where applicable (if original hardwoods are under carpet — check during demo)
- **Budget:** $3,500 (in SOW)

### Interior Paint
- **Walls:** Sherwin-Williams "Agreeable Gray" (SW 7029) — the #1 rental paint color. Warm neutral, photographs well, gender-neutral.
- **Trim/doors:** SW "Extra White" (SW 7006) — crisp contrast
- **Ceilings:** Flat white
- **Accent wall (optional):** Dark charcoal in living room behind fireplace to create focal point. Same "Iron Ore" from exterior.
- **Budget:** $2,000 (in SOW)

### Drywall/Ceiling
- Repair holes throughout
- Demo damaged ceiling sections (mold noted in appraisal)
- Replace and finish — smooth or light knockdown texture
- **Budget:** $1,500 (in SOW)

### Trim/Doors/Hardware
- Repair damaged baseboards, door casings
- New door knobs + hinges — **matte black** to match modern aesthetic
- White trim throughout (paint existing where possible, replace where damaged)
- **Budget:** $1,000 (in SOW)

### Light Fixtures
- All new fixtures in every room
- **Living/dining:** Modern flush mount or semi-flush (black + brass)
- **Kitchen:** Pendant lights over counter/island area (brass finish)
- **Bedrooms:** Simple flush mount (white or brushed nickel)
- **Bathrooms:** Vanity bar lights (brass to match fixtures)
- **Budget:** $2,300 (in SOW) — plenty for rental-grade modern fixtures from Home Depot/Amazon

### Electrical
- New GFCI outlets in kitchen + bathrooms (code requirement)
- New switches + outlets where needed
- Included in $2,300 budget

**Interior subtotal: $10,300**

## KITCHEN — The Hero Room

This is where tenants fall in love. The blue/white/brass combo is on-trend and photographs beautifully.

### Cabinets
- **Lower:** Navy/dark blue shaker-style cabinets
- **Upper:** White shaker-style cabinets
- **Hardware:** Brushed brass pulls and knobs
- Source: RTA (ready-to-assemble) from Lily Ann Cabinets, CliqStudios, or Home Depot in-stock

## PRIMARY BATHROOM — Luxury on a Budget

- **Brushed brass** faucet + fixtures
- **Budget:** $300 (in SOW)

## FIREPLACE — Electric Insert Recommendation

### Current State
- Wood-burning fireplace, 1 unit
- Likely original to 1938 build
- Appraiser noted it exists, no condition issues flagged

### Recommendation: Electric Insert
- **Why:** Rental property = zero maintenance, no chimney cleaning, no liability, no gas line cost
- **What:** Electric fireplace insert that fits existing firebox opening
  - Recommendation: **Dimplex Revillusion 24"** ($400-600) or **Touchstone Sideline** ($300-500)
  - Realistic flame effect, remote control, heats 400 sf
- **Surround treatment:**
  - Option A: Paint existing brick/surround in dark charcoal (matches accent wall) — $0 extra, just paint
  - Option B: Tile over with stacked stone veneer or large format porcelain — $200-500
  - Add a clean wood or painted mantel shelf — $50-150

### Design Impact
- Paint the fireplace wall dark (Iron Ore accent wall)
- White or natural wood mantel shelf
- Electric insert with flame effect
- LVP flooring running up to the hearth
- **Total cost:** $400-800 (insert + mantel)
- **Not in original SOW** — pull from contingency or "Other" line ($500 mold remediation may have surplus)

## MECHANICALS

### Plumbing
- New vanity connections (both baths)
- Kitchen sink plumbing (new layout after wall removal)
- Water heater: service if functional, replace only if needed
- **Budget:** $500 (in SOW — tight, assumes no major issues)

- Minor duct work repair/replacement
- **Budget:** $500 (in SOW — assumes system is functional)

### Crawl Space
- New door/casing + lock
- **Budget:** $350 (in SOW)

### Mold Remediation
- As needed — appraisal showed ceiling mold presence
- Treat and seal before drywall repair
- **Budget:** $500 (in SOW)

### Budget Risks
- **Plumbing ($500):** Very tight if any surprises. May need contingency.
- **HVAC ($500):** If system needs more than service, this blows up fast.
- **Kitchen cabinets + counters ($5,000):** Tight for custom look. Use RTA cabinets to stay in budget.
- **Load-bearing wall:** If kitchen/dining wall is load-bearing, add $1,000-1,500 for beam/header.
- **Fireplace insert:** Not in SOW. Use contingency surplus or mold line item.

### Budget Cushion Strategy
- Contingency: $2,290 covers most surprises
- Mold budget may not be fully used
- HVAC may not need all $500
- **Net risk: manageable if no major mechanical failures**

## DESIGN MOOD: References

**Exterior inspo:** Search "dark modern ranch exterior" or "black house wood porch" — the look is trending hard on Zillow/Instagram for exactly this reason.

**Kitchen inspo:** Search "navy blue white kitchen brass hardware" — this is a proven rental/sale combo that photographs beautifully and appeals to wide demographics.

**Bathroom inspo:** Search "walk in tile shower gold fixtures" — the primary bath shower is the listing photo hero.

**Fireplace inspo:** Search "electric fireplace dark accent wall" — minimal cost, maximum visual impact.
