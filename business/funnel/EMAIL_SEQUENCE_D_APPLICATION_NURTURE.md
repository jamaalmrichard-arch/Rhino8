## EMAIL 1 — Day 0 (Immediate after application submitted)
**Template: 1 (Premium Branded)**

**Subject:** Application received — here's what happens next
**Preview text:** You're in. Here's the process.

---

{first_name},

Got your application. Thank you for taking this step.

Here's exactly what happens next:

**Step 1:** I personally review every application within 48 hours. I'm looking for people who are serious about executing — not just collecting information.

**Step 2:** If you're a fit, you'll receive a link to book your strategy call with me. The call is 30 minutes.

**Step 3:** On the call, we'll map out your personalized 6-month wealth plan together. We'll look at where you are now (your workbook numbers), where you want to be, and the fastest path to get there.

**The call is free — and the plan is yours to keep whether you join the program or not.** No bait and switch. No pressure. Just strategy.

Keep an eye on your inbox over the next 48 hours.

In the meantime, if you haven't finished your FIRE Workbook, now's the time. The more complete your numbers are before the call, the more specific and actionable your plan will be.

## EMAIL 2 — Day 1
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** What to expect on your strategy call
**Preview text:** This is not a sales pitch.

---

{first_name},

I want to set expectations for your strategy call so you get the most out of it.

**This is not a sales pitch.** It's a strategy session. Here's what we'll cover:

**First 5 minutes:** I'll ask about your current situation — income, savings, debt, real estate experience. Be honest. I've heard everything. There's no judgment.

**Next 15 minutes:** We'll build your 6-month roadmap together. Based on where you are, I'll lay out the exact steps — which strategy to start with (wholesale, BRRRR, or both), how much capital you need, where to find it, and what your first 90 days look like.

**Last 10 minutes:** I'll tell you honestly whether the coaching program is the right fit for you. For some people it is. For others, the workbook and books are enough to get started on their own. I'll tell you straight.

**How to prepare:**
1. Have your FIRE Workbook Module 1 (budget P&L) filled out
2. Know your approximate credit score
3. Know what's in your retirement accounts (even a rough number)
4. Think about your 12-month goal — what does success look like for you?

That's it. 30 minutes. A real plan. No games.

## EMAIL 3 — Day 2
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** Why I only take 15 people per cohort
**Preview text:** I could take 100. I choose 15.

---

{first_name},

A lot of coaching programs pack in as many people as they can. 50, 100, 200 students. Maximize revenue. Minimize attention.

I do the opposite.

15 people per cohort. That's it. Here's why:

I personally review every deal my students bring. I can't do that for 100 people. I can do it for 15.

I run every call myself. No assistants. No junior coaches. When you're on a Tuesday strategy call, you're talking to the person who closed $250 million in real estate. Not someone who read a book about it.

And I know every student's situation — their budget, their goals, their blockers. When David brought me his first BRRRR deal, I knew his exact financial picture. I could tell him "this deal works for YOU" — not generic advice that works for nobody.

That's the difference between a program and a partnership.

15 spots. That's all I can serve at this level.

Talk soon.

## EMAIL 4 — Day 3-4 (If they haven't booked the call)
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** Quick question about your application
**Preview text:** Just checking in.

---

{first_name},

Your application was approved — but I noticed you haven't booked your strategy call yet.

Sometimes life gets busy. I get it.

Just wanted to make sure the booking link didn't get lost in your inbox. Here it is:

[Book Your Strategy Call →]

We're reviewing applications for the current cohort through Friday. After that, the next opening is in 3 months.

The call is 30 minutes. We'll map out your 6-month plan together. It's free whether you join the program or not.

If the timing changed and this isn't right for you anymore, no worries at all. Just reply "not now" and I'll remove the hold on your spot.
