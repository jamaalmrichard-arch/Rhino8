### KEY SELLING POINTS

- Written by someone with $250M+ in actual transactions, not a YouTube guru who took a weekend course
- Specifically designed for the current high-rate, high-inventory market -- not recycled 2020 advice
- Audio modules let you learn on-the-go (commute, gym, lunch break) -- first time you hear the real voice behind Money Decoded
- Templates are fill-in-the-blank ready, not theoretical frameworks you have to figure out
- The wholesaling module alone can produce $5K-$15K on a single deal -- the product pays for itself on deal one
- Bridges directly to coaching: "You have the playbook. Now get someone in your ear who's done $250M telling you 'go' or 'stop' in real time."

---

### BRIDGE TO COACHING APPLICATION

The final audio module (Module 6) ends with a direct, personal message:

"You now have everything you need to close your first deal. The playbook, the scripts, the templates, the 90-day plan. But I want to be honest with you -- the hardest part isn't knowing what to do. It's having someone tell you when to pull the trigger and when to walk away. That's the difference between the people who close deals and the people who study deals forever. If you want me in your ear for the next 6 months -- reviewing your deals, running the numbers with you, telling you exactly what I'd do -- there's a way to make that happen. I'll send you the details."

## TRACK 2: THE WEALTH SHIFT
### "How to Reposition Your Money from Wall Street to Main Street"

**Price:** $197
**Format:** 72-page PDF guide + 5 audio modules (real voice, ~18 min each) + 8 worksheets/calculators + 2 case study breakdowns
**Target Audience:** High-net-worth W-2 professionals, corporate earners with $100K-$500K+ in retirement accounts, "RE stupid" smart people who know they should be in real estate but don't know how, people who want passive income without becoming a landlord full-time.
**Progressive Reveal Element:** Audio modules are recorded in J. Marque's real voice. The tone is more measured, sophisticated, advisory -- like having a private wealth strategist brief you. This is the first time passive track buyers hear the person behind Money Decoded.

---

### TABLE OF CONTENTS

**Module 1: The Silent Wealth Drain**
A data-driven breakdown of what your current portfolio is actually costing you. Covers management fees (the average 401(k) loses 1-2% annually to fees alone), tax drag, inflation erosion, and opportunity cost. Includes the Wealth Drain Calculator -- input your current balances and see exactly how much you're losing per year to the system you're in. Most people discover they're losing $3,000-$15,000 annually without knowing it.

**Module 2: The SDIRA Playbook -- Your Retirement Money, Your Rules**
How to move 401(k), IRA, and pension funds into a Self-Directed IRA that can invest in real estate. Covers the mechanics of SDIRA setup, custodian selection, prohibited transactions, and the exact steps to roll over without penalties or taxes. Includes the SDIRA Custodian Comparison Sheet and the Rollover Checklist (21 steps, in order).

**Module 3: Cash Flow Replacement Math**
How much rental income do you need to replace your W-2? This module runs the math backwards from your target monthly income to the exact number of units, price points, and returns you need. Covers the 3 passive ownership models (direct ownership, syndication, fund investment) and which one fits your capital level and time commitment. Includes the Cash Flow Replacement Calculator.

**Module 4: Due Diligence for the Busy Professional**
You don't have time to drive neighborhoods and screen tenants. This module covers how to evaluate deals remotely, build a local team you trust, and set up property management so your involvement is 2-3 hours per month. Covers the 7 metrics that matter for passive investors, red flags that kill deals, and the "30-Minute Deal Review" framework. Includes the Passive Investor Due Diligence Checklist.

**Module 5: The Repositioning Roadmap**
Your personalized 6-month plan for moving money from underperforming accounts into cash-flowing real estate. Covers tax implications, timing strategies, how much to move and when, and the 3 phases of repositioning (audit, transition, deploy).

### KEY SELLING POINTS

- Designed for people with money, not people looking for money -- respects your intelligence and your time
- The Wealth Drain Calculator alone will show you $3K-$15K/year you're losing to fees, taxes, and inflation you didn't know about
- Audio modules are briefing-style -- 18 minutes each, designed for professionals who don't have time for 3-hour YouTube videos
- Covers the SDIRA strategy that most financial advisors won't tell you about (because they lose your assets under management)
- Written from $250M in real transaction experience, not from a textbook or a podcast
- The case studies show real numbers: David's $80K 401(k) rollover into SDIRA, deployed into BRRRR, now producing $730/month passive -- from money that was earning 6% in a target-date fund
- Higher price point ($197) signals quality and filters for serious buyers -- this isn't a $7 ebook

### BRIDGE TO COACHING APPLICATION

The final audio module (Module 5) closes with:

"You now know exactly what's happening to your money, where it should be, and how to get it there. But here's what I've learned from doing this for 15 years -- the gap between knowing the strategy and executing it is where most high-earners get stuck. Not because they're not smart. Because they're smart enough to know that one wrong move with $200K could be catastrophic. That's why every serious repositioning I've overseen has had one thing in common: someone who's done it before sitting next to the person doing it for the first time. If you want that for your situation -- someone who's moved hundreds of millions in real estate, reviewing your specific numbers, your specific accounts, your specific market -- I have a way to make that happen. Details coming to your inbox."

## TRACK 3: THE FOUNDATION
### "The Complete Financial Blueprint for Future Investors"

**Price:** $97
**Format:** 60-page PDF workbook + 7 audio modules (real voice, ~12 min each) + 9 worksheets/templates + printable action plan
**Target Audience:** Complete beginners, people starting from zero or near-zero, people who need to get their financial house in order before investing. Teachers, service workers, military, young professionals, anyone who knows they need to do something but doesn't know where to start.
**Progressive Reveal Element:** Audio modules are recorded in J. Marque's real voice. The tone is encouraging, patient, and direct -- like having a mentor who believes in you but won't let you make excuses. First time foundation track buyers hear the person behind the books.

**Note:** This is the rebranded and expanded FIRE Workbook, repositioned specifically for the "starting from scratch" audience. Same core content (budget, risk management, lender prep, net worth, retirement accounts, team building, first deal checklist) but reframed with language and context for beginners rather than people who already know they want to invest.

---

### TABLE OF CONTENTS

**Module 1: Where You Actually Stand -- The Budget P&L**
Before you can build wealth, you need to know where your money goes. This module walks you through building a complete household profit & loss statement. Income vs. expenses. Fixed, variable, hybrid. No judgment -- just clarity. Most people who complete this module find $200-$800/month they didn't know they were losing to subscriptions, lifestyle creep, and "phantom expenses." Includes the Budget P&L Template.

**Module 2: Protecting What You Have -- Risk Management**
The Pyramid of Needs: Risk Management comes BEFORE wealth building. Covers life insurance, disability insurance, property & casualty, health insurance gaps, and emergency fund sizing. Most people have 2-3 insurance gaps that could wipe them out. This module finds them before life does. Includes the Insurance Gap Audit Worksheet.

**Module 3: Getting Lender-Ready -- Keys to the Safe**
When opportunity shows up, are your documents ready? This module builds your lender file: check stubs, tax returns, IRS transcripts, bank statements, credit reports, letters of explanation. Everything organized so when you're ready to buy your first property, you don't lose it because your paperwork wasn't in order. Includes the Lender-Ready Document Checklist.

**Module 4: What You Own vs. What You Owe -- Balance Sheet**
Four asset classes: Paper (stocks, bonds, retirement), Business (side hustles, equity), Real Estate (property, equity), Commodities (gold, silver, crypto). Your liabilities: mortgage, car notes, student loans, credit cards. Your real net worth -- the number that matters, not the one you tell yourself. Includes the Personal Balance Sheet Template.

**Module 5: Your Net Worth Number -- And How to Change It**
Now that you know your net worth, this module creates the plan to change it. Covers debt reduction strategies (avalanche vs. snowball), income optimization, and the wealth accumulation formula. Sets your 6-month, 12-month, and 36-month net worth targets. Includes the Net Worth Growth Planner.

**Module 6: Money You Already Have -- Retirement Accounts**
Where your retirement money actually sits, what it's earning, what it's costing you in fees, and what it would look like repositioned. Most people have $10K-$500K in accounts they barely think about, earning 6-8% while paying 1-2% in hidden fees. This module opens your eyes. Includes the Retirement Account Audit Worksheet.

**Module 7: Building Your Team -- The 4 People You Need**
Handyman. Real estate agent. Home inspector. Mortgage broker. These are the 4 people you need before your first property. This module shows you how to find them, vet them, and build relationships before you need them. Plus: your first deal checklist and tenant screening process. Includes the Team Builder Contact Sheet and the First Deal Checklist.

---

### KEY SELLING POINTS

- No shame, no judgment, no "you should have started 10 years ago" -- this is for people starting NOW
- The Budget P&L module alone typically reveals $200-$800/month in wasted spending -- pays for the product immediately
- Audio modules are encouraging but direct: "This is where you are. Here's where you're going. Let's move."
- The Lender-Ready checklist would cost $200+ from a financial advisor -- having it ready means you don't miss your first deal because of paperwork
- Every module builds on the previous one -- by Module 7, you have a complete financial picture and a clear next step
- This is the exact workbook Keisha used before she bought her first property (teacher, $52K salary, 3 properties in 11 months)

---

### BRIDGE TO COACHING APPLICATION

The final audio module (Module 7) closes with:

"You just did something most people never do. You looked at your finances honestly. You found the gaps. You built the file. You mapped out your team. You have a plan. That takes guts, and I respect the hell out of it. Now here's the truth: the workbook got you ready. But ready and done are two different things. The people who actually close their first deal -- the ones who go from 'I have a plan' to 'I have a property' -- they all had one thing in common. They had someone walking with them. Not a YouTube video. Not a course. A person. Someone who's done $250 million in real estate, who can look at their specific situation and say 'here's your next move.' If you want that, I have something for you. Keep an eye on your inbox."
