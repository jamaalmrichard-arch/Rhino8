## EMAIL 1 — Day 0 (Immediate after $7 purchase)

**Subject:** Smart move — your trilogy is ready
**Preview text:** You're ahead of 99% of people right now.

---

{first_name},

Done.

You now have access to all three Money Decoded books. Here's your download link:

[Access your trilogy →]

Quick reading guide:
- **Book 1** — the foundation. How money was designed to control you.
- **Book 2** — the machine. How the modern system drains your wealth daily.
- **Book 3** — the playbook. What to actually do about it.

Read them in order. It builds.

Most people who buy the trilogy tell me the same thing: the books opened their eyes. But then they ask the same question:

**"OK, I get it. Now what do I actually DO?"**

That's the right question. And I have the answer. I'll share it with you in a couple days — after you've had time to dig into the books.

For now, start reading.

— J. Marque

P.S. Book 2, the section on fractional reserve banking — that's the one that made me rethink everything when I first learned it. Let me know if it hits you the same way.

## EMAIL 2 — Day 2

**Subject:** Knowledge without action is entertainment
**Preview text:** The gap between knowing and doing.

---

{first_name},

By now you've probably gotten through at least Book 1, maybe started Book 2.

You know things most people will never know:
- How money went from gold to government promises
- How banks create money from thin air
- How inflation is designed to transfer wealth upward
- What's coming next and who's already positioning

That puts you ahead of 99% of the population.

But here's the truth I learned after $250 million in real estate transactions:

**Knowing how money works and building wealth are two completely different skills.**

One is education. The other is execution.

The trilogy gave you the education. But education without a plan is just trivia at dinner parties.

What separates the people who actually build wealth from the people who just understand it?

**A system.** A step-by-step process that takes you from "I get it" to "I'm doing it."

That's exactly what I built. I call it the FIRE Workbook — Financially Independent, Retire Early.

It's 7 modules that take you from where you are right now to being completely ready to invest in real estate and build passive income. Budget. Net worth. Insurance. Lender readiness. Your investment team. Your first deal checklist.

I'll break it down for you in my next email.

## EMAIL 3 — Day 4

**Subject:** Your 90-day wealth plan — 7 modules
**Preview text:** From "I understand money" to "I'm building wealth."

---

{first_name},

Here's what's inside the FIRE Workbook:

**Module 1: It All Starts with a Budget**
Your household P&L. Income vs. expenses. Fixed, variable, hybrid. You can't build wealth if you don't know where your money goes. This module gives you the template and walks you through it.

**Module 2: Understanding Risk Management**
The Pyramid of Needs — Risk Management → Wealth Accumulation → Wealth Preservation. Life insurance. Disability. Property & casualty. The gaps most people don't know they have until it's too late.

**Module 3: Keys to the Safe**
The lender-ready checklist. Check stubs, tax returns, IRS transcripts, bank statements, credit reports. Everything you need compiled before you ever talk to a lender. When opportunity shows up, you'll be ready.

**Module 4-5: Your Balance Sheet & Net Worth**
Four asset classes: Paper, Business, Real Estate, Commodities. Your liabilities. Your total net worth — the real number, not the one you tell yourself. And a plan to change it.

**Module 6: Retirement Accounts**
Where your money actually sits. What it's worth. What you'd get if you repositioned it. Most people have $50K-$500K trapped in accounts earning 6-8% when real estate can return 15-30%. This module shows you the math.

**Module 7: Your FIRE Team**
Handyman. Real estate agent. Home inspector. Mortgage broker. The four people you need before you buy your first property. Plus: your first deal checklist and tenant screening process.

**The trilogy is the MAP. The workbook is the GPS.**

One weekend. 7 modules. You come out the other side knowing exactly where you stand and exactly what to do next.

This isn't more reading. This is doing.

— J. Marque

P.S. Module 3 alone — the lender-ready checklist — would cost you $200+ if a financial advisor put it together. Having your documents organized before you need them is the difference between closing a deal and watching someone else close it.

## EMAIL 4 — Day 7

**Subject:** {first_name}, still thinking about it?
**Preview text:** Let me address the real question.

---

{first_name},

I know $97 isn't $7. So let me be straight with you.

Here's what $97 actually costs you:

Your savings account is losing $300-$800/year to inflation. You already know this — you read Book 2.

One decision from the FIRE Workbook — just ONE — whether it's finding an insurance gap, repositioning a retirement account, or building your lender file so you're ready when a deal shows up — pays for the workbook 10x over.

But honestly? The workbook isn't about $97.

It's about the difference between **understanding** how money works and actually **doing something about it.**

The trilogy showed you the game. The workbook puts you in it.

7 modules. Budget. Net worth. Insurance. Lender docs. Your team. Your first deal checklist.

If the timing isn't right, I respect that. I'll keep sending you value every week — no pitch, just insights on money, wealth, and real estate.

But if you're serious about going from knowledge to action, this is the bridge.

— J. Marque

P.S. Everyone who's gone through the workbook says the same thing: "I wish I'd done this 5 years ago." The second best time is now.
