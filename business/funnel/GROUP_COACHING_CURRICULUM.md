## PROGRAM OVERVIEW

### What This Program Delivers
A 6-month guided execution system that takes students from financial confusion to real estate cash flow. Built on the same system behind $250M+ in real estate transactions. Students complete the FIRE Workbook, learn 8 RE strategies, analyze real deals, make real offers, and close real transactions -- with J. Marque personally reviewing every deal.

### Weekly Structure

| Day | Call Type | Time | Format |
|-----|-----------|------|--------|
| Tuesday | Strategy Session | 60 min | Teaching + Q&A (J. Marque teaches, students learn) |
| Thursday | Hot Seat | 60 min | Coaching + deal review (students bring situations, J. Marque solves) |

### The 3 Phases

| Phase | Weeks | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Foundation | 1-8 | FIRE Workbook, financial clarity, mindset, market prep | Complete financial picture, lender-ready file, credit plan, team started |
| Execution | 9-18 | Deal finding, analysis, offers, funding, first deal | First deal under contract or closed, wholesale revenue or rental acquired |
| Scale | 19-26 | Portfolio building, tax strategy, systems, wealth preservation | Repeatable system, 2-4 doors or $20K+ wholesale revenue, exit plan |

### The 8 RE Strategies Taught (in order of introduction)

1. **Wholesale** -- Quick cash, no capital needed (Phase 2, Weeks 9-12)
2. **BRRRR** -- Long-term wealth engine (Phase 2, Weeks 13-15)
3. **Fix & Flip** -- Larger cash injections (Phase 2, Week 16)
4. **Subject-To** -- Low/no money down acquisitions (Phase 2, Weeks 17-18)
5. **Seller Finance** -- Negotiate your own terms (Phase 3, Week 19)
6. **Wraparound Mortgage** -- Advanced spread play (Phase 3, Week 20)
7. **Lease Option** -- Control without owning (Phase 3, Week 21)
8. **Multifamily** -- Scale unit count fast (Phase 3, Weeks 22-23)

### The 3 Wealth Levers (Core Framework)

1. **Cash Flow** -- Money coming in monthly whether you work or not
2. **Equity** -- Buying below market, forcing appreciation through renovation/management
3. **Tax Advantage** -- Depreciation, 1031 exchanges, cost segregation, self-directed IRAs

Every strategy taught maps back to at least one lever. Students learn to pull all three simultaneously.

|------|---------|---------|
| 0:00-5:00 | Recap | Mid-program energy check. Celebrate deals in progress. |
| 5:00-20:00 | Subject-To Explained | What it is: you buy the property, the seller's loan stays in place, you make the payments. Why sellers say yes: foreclosure relief, payment fatigue, divorce, relocation, inherited property. You get the deed, the seller gets relief. |
| 20:00-35:00 | The Due-On-Sale Clause | What it is (contractual right, not a law). Why enforcement is extremely rare when payments are current. The Garn-St. Germain Act exceptions. The land trust strategy. Risk mitigation: keep payments current, autopay to servicer, maintain insurance, keep reserves. |
| 35:00-50:00 | Sub-To Math | Example: Existing loan $180K @ 3.5%. Monthly PITI $1,100. FMV $230K. Rent $1,800. Cash to seller $3,000. Cash flow: $450/mo. Cash-on-cash: 180%. Instant equity: $50K. This is why sub-to is the most powerful creative finance strategy. |

**Cancellation/Makeup Policy:**
- J. Marque may cancel up to 2 calls during the 6-month program (holidays, emergencies)
- Canceled calls are made up with a bonus call the following week or extended Q&A session
- If J. Marque cancels, a pre-recorded training drops in the community as a substitute

**Emergency Deal Support:**
- If a student gets a deal under contract, they can message J. Marque directly for a quick review (within 24 hours)
- This is NOT unlimited 1-on-1 coaching -- it's a deal review to ensure the student doesn't lose money on a bad deal
- Format: student submits deal summary + numbers in a standard template, J. Marque responds with go/no-go + notes

**Scaling Note:**
- This curriculum is designed for J. Marque to run solo with 15 students
- At 2+ cohorts running simultaneously, consider hiring a community manager ($500-$1,000/month) to handle daily community monitoring, recording uploads, and scheduling
- At 4+ cohorts, consider training a junior coach to run Thursday hot seats for earlier-stage students
