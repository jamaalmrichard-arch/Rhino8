## EMAIL 1 — Day 0 (Immediate after $97 purchase)
**Template: 1 (Premium Branded)**

**Subject:** Welcome to the inner circle
**Preview text:** You just invested in yourself. Here's what's next.

---

{first_name},

Most people read about money. Some people buy a book about it. A few buy the workbook.

You just separated yourself from the crowd.

The FIRE Workbook isn't information — it's implementation. Seven modules that take you from understanding the system to working the system.

Here's how to get the most out of it:

**Start with Module 1 this week.** Pull up your bank statements from the last 90 days. Fill in the budget P&L. Don't judge the numbers — just see them. That's the first step.

Then move through Modules 2-7 over the next 2-3 weeks. By the time you finish Module 7, you'll have:
- A complete picture of your finances
- Your insurance gaps identified
- Your lender file ready
- Your investment team mapped out
- A checklist for your first property

Over the next few weeks, I'm going to share some things that'll help you along the way — my story, the mistakes I made, and what I've seen work for people in your exact position.

Let's build.

## EMAIL 2 — Day 2
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** I almost quit in year 2
**Preview text:** The thing nobody tells you about building wealth.

---

{first_name},

I need to tell you something.

I've closed over $250 million in real estate. But in year 2, I almost walked away from all of it.

I was a Marine. Came out disciplined, focused, ready to conquer the world. Got into real estate because I saw what it could do — passive income, equity, generational wealth.

But the first two years were brutal.

I lost money on my first deal. My second deal fell apart at closing. I was working 14-hour days, burning through savings, and watching people around me collect paychecks while I collected stress.

My wife at the time thought I was crazy. My friends didn't get it. I had every reason to quit and go get a "real job."

But I'm a Marine. And Marines don't quit. We adjust, adapt, and push forward.

So I stopped doing what everyone told me to do. And I built a system.

Not a get-rich-quick scheme. Not a hack. A system — repeatable, predictable, boring. The kind of system that makes money while you sleep because every step is mapped out.

That system has now produced $250 million in transactions. Not because I'm special. Because the system is.

Tomorrow, I'll break down the 3 wealth levers that system is built on. They're the same levers you're going to pull with your FIRE Workbook.

## EMAIL 3 — Day 4
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** The 3 wealth levers nobody teaches you
**Preview text:** School teaches you zero of these.

---

{first_name},

There are only 3 ways to build real wealth. School teaches you zero of them.

**Lever 1: Cash Flow**
Money coming in every month whether you work or not. Rental income. Royalties. Dividends. Most people only know W-2 income — trading hours for dollars. The wealthy build systems that produce cash flow on autopilot.

Your FIRE Workbook Module 1 — the budget P&L — is step one. You need to know your current cash flow before you can build new streams.

**Lever 2: Equity**
Buying assets below market value and forcing appreciation through renovation, management improvement, or rezoning. This is how you create $50K-$100K in wealth on a single deal without waiting 20 years.

Your FIRE Workbook Modules 4-5 — the balance sheet — shows you what equity you already have and where to create more.

**Lever 3: Tax Advantage**
Real estate gives you depreciation, 1031 exchanges, cost segregation, and a dozen other tools to legally keep more of what you earn. The wealthy pay less in taxes than their employees. Not because of loopholes — because of strategy.

Module 6 of your workbook — retirement accounts — is where this starts. Understanding where your money is and how it's being taxed is the first step to repositioning it.

**Most people only pull Lever 1 — and even then, they're pulling the wrong one (W-2 income).** The people in my coaching program pull all 3 simultaneously.

How are you doing on the workbook? Reply and let me know which module you're on.

## EMAIL 4 — Day 6
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** {first_name}, meet David — he was exactly where you are
**Preview text:** From $95K salary to $6,800/mo passive.

---

{first_name},

I want you to meet David.

12 months ago, David was a 9-to-5 engineer making $95K a year. Good income by most standards. But he had zero wealth. No assets. No investments. A 401(k) that grew 6% in a good year and got crushed in a bad one.

He downloaded Money Decoded. Read all three books. Got angry — the productive kind. Bought the FIRE Workbook and spent a weekend filling it out.

What he found surprised him: he had $340K sitting in retirement accounts earning 6-8% annually. Meanwhile, rental properties in his market were returning 15-25%.

He joined my coaching program. Within 60 days:
- Repositioned $80K from his 401(k) into a self-directed IRA
- Used that to fund his first BRRRR rental
- Closed on a distressed property at $140K, put $35K into rehab
- Appraised at $225K, refinanced, pulled most of his capital back out
- Monthly rent: $1,850. Monthly expenses: $1,120. Cash flow: $730/month.

He repeated the process. 11 months in, David has 4 doors producing $6,800/month in gross rent and $2,400/month in cash flow.

He still has his engineering job. But he doesn't need it anymore.

David isn't special. He's not a real estate genius. He followed a system, had accountability, and executed.

That's what the program does.

More on that soon.

— J. Marque

P.S. David's biggest regret? "I wish I'd started 5 years ago." The second best time is now.

## EMAIL 5 — Day 8
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** 3 mistakes smart people make with money
**Preview text:** Smart people make the worst financial mistakes.

---

{first_name},

After $250 million in real estate and coaching dozens of students, I've noticed something:

Smart people make the WORST financial mistakes. Here's why.

**Mistake 1: Saving instead of acquiring.**
Smart people are disciplined. So they save. But saving in a system that devalues your currency 3-8% per year is like running on a treadmill and wondering why you're not getting anywhere. You already know this from Book 2. The fix: redirect cash flow from savings into cash-producing assets.

**Mistake 2: Diversifying too early.**
Wall Street taught you to "diversify." So you have a 401(k), a Roth, some index funds, maybe a little crypto. Sounds safe. But diversification before concentration is just spreading your weakness thin. The wealthy get rich by concentrating — going deep in ONE asset class until they master it. Then they diversify. Real estate is the asset class that has created more millionaires than any other. Focus there first.

**Mistake 3: Going it alone.**
This is the biggest one. Smart people think they can figure it out themselves. They watch YouTube. They read books. They analyze deals for months but never pull the trigger. Why? Because they don't have someone in their ear saying "this deal is good — move" or "that deal is bad — walk away." They don't have accountability. They don't have a system.

The FIRE Workbook handles Mistakes 1 and 2. But Mistake 3 — going it alone — that's the one that keeps people stuck for years.

If any of these hit home, reply and tell me. I read every email.

## EMAIL 6 — Day 10
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** From $0 to 3 rental properties in 11 months
**Preview text:** Different person. Same system. Same result.

---

{first_name},

Last year, Keisha had no real estate. No experience. No connections in the industry.

She was a teacher making $52K. Single mom. Thought real estate was for people with trust funds and rich parents.

She was wrong.

Keisha joined the coaching program in March. Here's her timeline:

Month 1-2: Completed the FIRE Workbook. Built her budget. Found $680/month she was wasting on subscriptions and lifestyle creep. Found $127K in a retirement account she'd forgotten about from an old employer.

Month 3: Closed her first wholesale deal. Assignment fee: $8,500. She cried. That was 2 months of take-home pay from teaching.

Month 4-5: Used the wholesale money plus a hard money loan to buy a distressed duplex for $165K. Put $28K into rehab.

Month 6: Rented both units. Gross rent: $2,900/month. Refinanced and pulled her capital back out.

Month 8-11: Repeated the process. Two more properties. Now she collects $4,200/month in rental income.

Keisha still teaches. She loves it. But now she does it because she wants to, not because she has to.

Different person. Different background. Same system. Same result.

The system works regardless of your starting point.

I'm opening applications for the next coaching cohort this week. I'll send you the details.

## EMAIL 7 — Day 12
**Template: 3 (Dark Premium)**

**Subject:** Applications are open — 15 spots
**Preview text:** 6 months. A system. Accountability. Results.

---

{first_name},

I've been sharing my story, the system, and real results from real people.

Now it's your turn.

**I'm opening applications for the next FIRE + Real Estate Coaching Cohort.**

Here's what you get for 6 months:

**2 live group calls per week**
Tuesday: Strategy session (market analysis, deal review, Q&A)
Thursday: Hot seat (you bring your situation, we solve it live)

**The complete FIRE execution system**
We walk through every module of the workbook together. Budget, net worth, insurance, lender prep, team building, first deal — step by step. No guessing.

**Private community access**
Connect with other members 24/7. Share deals, ask questions, celebrate wins. You're not doing this alone anymore.

**My personal deal review**
Bring me any deal and I'll run every exit strategy on it. Wholesale, BRRRR, flip, sub-to, seller finance. You'll know exactly what to do before you spend a dollar.

**The system behind $250 million in transactions**
Not theory. Not YouTube motivation. The actual system I use — the same one David used to get to $6,800/month and Keisha used to buy 3 properties in 11 months.

**The investment: $5,997**

Financing available — most students qualify for 12-60 month plans through our lending partners. Your monthly payment could be less than what you're losing to inflation in your savings account.

15 spots per cohort. When they're gone, the next one opens in 3 months.

[Apply for the Coaching Program →]

This isn't for everyone. I'm looking for people who:
- Have completed (or are completing) the FIRE Workbook
- Are ready to execute, not just learn
- Can commit to 2 calls per week for 6 months
- Want to build real estate wealth, not get-rich-quick schemes

If that's you, apply. If not, no hard feelings — I'll keep sending you value every week.

— J. Marque

P.S. The application takes 3 minutes. If you're accepted, you'll get a link to book a strategy call with me. On the call, we'll map out your personalized 6-month plan — whether you join the program or not. The call is free.

## EMAIL 8 — Day 15
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** 8 spots left — your questions answered
**Preview text:** The 4 questions everyone asks before joining.

---

{first_name},

We filled 7 spots in 3 days. 8 remain for this cohort.

Before you decide, let me answer the questions I get every single time:

**"Can I afford $5,997?"**
Financing is available through our lending partners. Most students qualify for monthly payments between $100-$250/month. David's first deal made $8,500 — more than the entire program cost. The ROI isn't theoretical. It's measurable.

**"What if I have no real estate experience?"**
Good. You have no bad habits to unlearn. Keisha was a teacher with zero experience. She owned 3 properties within 11 months. The program is designed for beginners who are serious about executing.

**"What if I don't have time? I work full-time."**
2 calls per week. 1 hour each. Tuesday evening and Thursday evening. Plus the work you do on your own schedule — reviewing deals, completing workbook modules, connecting in the community. David kept his engineering job the entire time. Keisha kept teaching. This isn't a full-time commitment. It's a strategic one.

**"What makes this different from YouTube or other courses?"**
YouTube is information. Courses are education. This is execution with accountability. I personally review your deals. I personally run the calls. You have access to someone who has closed $250 million in real estate and can tell you "do this, don't do that" in real time. That's the difference between watching cooking shows and having a chef in your kitchen.

[Apply Now — 8 Spots Remaining →]

Applications close when the cohort fills.

— J. Marque

P.S. The strategy call is free whether you join or not. I'll map out your 6-month plan on the call — it's yours to keep regardless.

## EMAIL 9 — Day 18
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** closing applications friday
**Preview text:** This is my last email about the program.

---

{first_name},

This is my last email about the coaching program until the next cohort.

Here's where things stand:
- We started with 15 spots
- 11 are filled
- 4 remain
- Applications close Friday

If you've been thinking about it, now's the time to decide.

If the timing isn't right — I genuinely respect that. Building wealth is a long game. There's no penalty for waiting. The next cohort opens in 3 months and I'll let you know when applications reopen.

If you're ready:

[Apply Before Friday →]

Either way, I'm not going anywhere. I'll keep sending you insights on money, wealth, and real estate every week. No pitch. Just value. Because the more you know, the better positioned you'll be — whether that's this cohort, the next one, or on your own.

I'm rooting for you.

— J. Marque

P.S. If the timing isn't right but you want to stay on the radar, reply "later" and I'll personally notify you when the next cohort opens. No strings.
