{first_name},

You chose the passive investor track. That tells me something.

You're not looking for a side hustle. You're not trying to become a full-time real estate investor. You have money, probably in retirement accounts or savings, and you know it should be doing more than what it's doing right now.

You're right. It should.

Here are your three Money Decoded books:

[Download Your Trilogy -->]

**Book 1** -- the history most people never learn. How money was designed.
**Book 2** -- how the modern system quietly moves wealth from your pocket to someone else's. Pay close attention to the section on management fees.
**Book 3** -- what people who actually build wealth do differently from everyone else.

Read them in order. Book 2 is where most passive track readers have their "wait a minute" moment. The numbers on hidden fees and inflation drag are hard to unsee once you see them.

Take your time with the books this week. I'll follow up in a couple days with something that connects directly to the track you chose.

Your money deserves a better strategy. These books are the first step toward one.

## EMAIL 2 — Day 2
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** You see the problem now -- here's the question
**Preview text:** Knowing fees are eating your retirement is step one. Step two is harder.

---

{first_name},

If you've started Book 2, you've seen the math on what your retirement accounts are actually costing you.

Management fees of 1-2% annually. Inflation erosion of 3-5%. Fund underperformance that compounds year after year. On a $300K portfolio, that's $4,500-$21,000 per year disappearing. Not in a crash. Not in a bad year. Every single year, whether the market is up or down.

You probably knew fees existed. Most high earners do. But seeing the actual dollar amount over 10, 20, 30 years changes the conversation.

So now you have a question. The same question every professional who reads Book 2 asks:

**"What do I actually DO about it?"**

Because knowing your 401(k) is underperforming doesn't fix it. Understanding that your financial advisor's incentives don't align with yours doesn't move your money. Seeing the math on SDIRAs doesn't mean you know how to execute a rollover, select a custodian, and deploy capital into real estate without making a six-figure mistake.

That's the gap. Knowledge to execution.

I built something specifically for that gap. It's called The Wealth Shift, and it's the execution plan for people in your position: professionals with money sitting in the wrong place, who now understand WHY it's in the wrong place, and need a step-by-step process to move it.

I'll break it down in my next email. Including the calculator that most people call the most uncomfortable 5 minutes of their financial life.

## EMAIL 3 — Day 4
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** What's inside The Wealth Shift
**Preview text:** 5 modules, 8 worksheets, and a calculator that changes how you see your portfolio.

---

{first_name},

Here's exactly what The Wealth Shift contains. 72 pages. Not theory. Strategy.

**Module 1: The Silent Wealth Drain.** Your current portfolio, laid bare. You'll plug your real numbers into the Wealth Drain Calculator and see exactly what you're losing per year to fees, tax drag, and inflation. Most people discover $3,000-$15,000 annually that they didn't know was leaving. This is the module that makes the problem impossible to ignore.

**Module 2: The SDIRA Playbook.** How to move 401(k), IRA, or pension money into a Self-Directed IRA that invests in real estate instead of index funds. Custodian selection. The 21-step Rollover Checklist. Prohibited transactions. How to execute the move without penalties or taxes. This is the strategy most financial advisors won't bring up because it moves your money off their books.

**Module 3: Cash Flow Replacement Math.** Running the numbers backwards from your target monthly income. How many units? At what price? What return? The 3 passive ownership models (direct, syndication, fund) and which one fits your capital level and time commitment. Includes the Cash Flow Replacement Calculator.

**Module 4: Due Diligence for the Busy Professional.** You're not quitting your job to screen tenants. This covers remote deal evaluation, building a local team you trust, property management setup, and the "30-Minute Deal Review" framework. Your involvement post-setup: 2-3 hours per month.

**Module 5: The Repositioning Roadmap.** Your personalized 6-month plan. How much to move and when. Tax implications. Timing. The 3 phases: audit, transition, deploy.

Plus 5 audio briefings. 18 minutes each. Recorded in my actual voice. Built for your commute. Not YouTube hype. Briefing-style, the way you'd want a private wealth strategist to talk to you.

8 worksheets and calculators included. The Wealth Drain Calculator. The Rollover Checklist. The Cash Flow Replacement Calculator. Due diligence scorecard. Tax impact worksheet. All of it.

$197.

David had $340K in two retirement accounts. He ran the Wealth Drain Calculator and found $7,400/year walking out the door to fees and underperformance. He repositioned $80K through an SDIRA into his first rental. That single property now produces $730/month. His old 401(k) was producing $170/month in paper gains on the same money. Same dollars. Different vehicle. 22% cash-on-cash return versus 6%.

Marcus deployed $200K from an underperforming brokerage account into two rental properties. Net cash flow: $1,600/month. His brokerage account was producing $800/month in dividends. He doubled his income from the same capital.

## EMAIL 4 — Day 7
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** The real cost of waiting
**Preview text:** $197 now vs $3K-$15K per year you keep losing.

---

{first_name},

I'll be direct.

$197 is what I'm asking. Here's what you're paying if you don't.

The average professional with $200K-$500K in retirement accounts loses $3,000-$15,000 per year to management fees, inflation erosion, and opportunity cost. That's not a projection. That's the math from the Wealth Drain Calculator, confirmed by hundreds of people who've run their own numbers through it.

In 12 months, doing nothing costs you $3K-$15K.
In 5 years, doing nothing costs you $15K-$75K.
In 10 years, you don't want to see the number.

$197 is less than one month of what most portfolios lose silently.

A few things I hear:

**"I want to think about it."**
I respect that. But think about this: David thought about it for 6 months before he moved. During those 6 months, he lost another $3,700 to fees and underperformance. His only regret is not starting sooner.

**"I already have a financial advisor."**
Good. Keep them. But ask yourself one question: have they ever mentioned a Self-Directed IRA? If the answer is no, their blind spot is costing you real money. The Wealth Shift fills the gap your advisor won't.

**"$197 for a digital product seems high."**
Compared to what? David repositioned $80K and now earns $730/month from it. Marcus deployed $200K and doubled his monthly income. The Wealth Drain Calculator alone will show you thousands you didn't know you were losing. If one insight from this product saves you even $500 this year, you made your money back twice over.

If now isn't the right time, no pressure. I'll keep sending you wealth strategy insights every week. No pitch. Just analysis.

But every month that passes, the Wealth Drain Calculator keeps running. And it doesn't wait for you to be ready.

Your money deserves better than 6% minus fees.

-- J. Marque

P.S. Module 2 on SDIRAs is the one that changes everything for most people. The 21-step Rollover Checklist alone takes a process that feels intimidating and turns it into a straightforward sequence. David said the hardest part was the first phone call to the custodian. "After that, I wondered why I'd waited so long."
