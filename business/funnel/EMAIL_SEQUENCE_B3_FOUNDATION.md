**Subject:** Respect -- your books are ready
**Preview text:** You said you're building from the ground up. That takes guts. Here are your books.

{first_name},

You said you want to build your base first.

That's not a weakness. That's the smartest thing you could have picked. Every investor who's built real wealth started by getting their financial house in order before they made their first deal. The ones who skipped that step? Most of them are the ones telling "I lost everything" stories on Reddit.

You're doing this right.

Here are your three Money Decoded books:

[Download Your Trilogy -->]

**Book 1** -- how money actually works. The version they didn't teach in school.
**Book 2** -- the system that moves money from people like us to the people running the system.
**Book 3** -- what to do about it. The playbook.

Read them in order. Don't rush. Let Book 1 sink in before you move to Book 2. By the time you finish Book 3, the way you think about money will be different. Permanently different.

I'll check in with you in a couple days. For now, start reading.

You're already ahead of most people just by being here.

## EMAIL 2 — Day 2
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** Eyes open is just the beginning
**Preview text:** The trilogy showed you the truth. But truth without a plan is just stress.

---

{first_name},

If you've started the trilogy, something has probably shifted.

You're starting to see how the system actually works. How banks create money from nothing. How inflation is a silent tax on everyone who saves in a traditional account. How the rules are written by people who benefit from you not knowing the rules.

That's the point of the books. To open your eyes.

But I've watched hundreds of people get to this exact moment and freeze. Because once your eyes are open, the natural reaction is: "OK, I see the problem. Now what? Where do I even start?"

Without a plan, open eyes just create overwhelm.

And overwhelm leads to the worst possible outcome: doing nothing. Going back to the same habits. Letting the system keep running the way it's always run, with your money feeding it.

That's not going to be you.

I built something called The Foundation. It's a workbook. 7 modules. Each one builds on the last. It starts exactly where you are right now and walks you through everything you need to get your financial house in order before you ever think about investing.

Your budget. Your net worth. Your insurance gaps. Your lender file. Your retirement accounts. Your team. Your first deal checklist.

It's not more reading about the problem. It's doing something about it.

I'll break down all 7 modules in my next email. There's one in particular -- Module 1 -- that usually changes everything in about an hour.

## EMAIL 3 — Day 4
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** 7 modules. 9 worksheets. One hour to start.
**Preview text:** What's inside The Foundation -- and why Module 1 finds money you didn't know you had.

---

{first_name},

Here's what The Foundation covers. 60 pages. 7 audio modules in my real voice. 9 worksheets you actually fill in.

**Module 1: Where You Actually Stand -- Budget P&L.** Pull up your last 90 days of bank statements. Fill in the template. No judgment. Just numbers. Most people who complete this module find $200-$800/month they didn't know they were losing. Subscriptions they forgot about. Delivery apps that added up. Small charges from services they signed up for years ago. Keisha found $680/month. In one Saturday morning, she found more money than most "savings tips" produce in a year. This module alone is worth the price of the workbook.

**Module 2: Risk Management.** The stuff nobody wants to talk about. Life insurance, disability, property and casualty. The Pyramid of Needs says risk management comes BEFORE wealth building. Most people have 2-3 insurance gaps that could wipe them out. This module finds them before life does.

**Module 3: Getting Lender-Ready.** Check stubs, tax returns, IRS transcripts, bank statements, credit reports, letters of explanation. All organized. All ready. When a deal shows up, you won't lose it because your paperwork was a mess. This checklist alone would cost $200+ if a financial advisor put it together for you.

**Module 4: Your Balance Sheet.** What you own vs what you owe. Four asset classes. Your liabilities. Your real net worth. Not the number you tell yourself. The real one. That clarity is where change starts.

**Module 5: Net Worth Planning.** Now that you know your number, this module creates the plan to change it. Debt reduction. Income optimization. 6-month, 12-month, and 36-month targets.

**Module 6: Retirement Accounts.** Where your money actually sits. What it's earning. What it's costing in hidden fees. Most people have money in accounts they barely think about, earning 6-8% while paying 1-2% in fees. Keisha found a forgotten retirement account worth $127,000.

**Module 7: Building Your Team.** Handyman. Real estate agent. Home inspector. Mortgage broker. The 4 people you need before your first property. Plus your first deal checklist and tenant screening process.

Every module has an audio version. 12 minutes each. My real voice, not text-to-speech. Listen on your commute. While you cook dinner. While you take the dog out. Built so you can keep moving while you learn.

$97.

Keisha was a teacher making $52K. Single mom. She went through The Foundation. Found $680/month she was hemorrhaging. Found a $127K retirement account she'd forgotten about. 11 months later, she owns 3 properties and collects $4,200/month in rental income.

She didn't skip steps. She didn't jump ahead. She started with Module 1 on a Saturday morning.

## EMAIL 4 — Day 7
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** {first_name}, no shame in starting here
**Preview text:** $97 vs the $200-$800/month you don't know you're losing.

{first_name},

I want to say something directly.

There's a voice in your head saying you should already know this stuff. That everyone else has their finances figured out. That starting from scratch at your age, in your situation, means you're behind.

That voice is wrong.

I came out of the Marines with a few thousand dollars, a credit score in the low 600s, and zero understanding of how money actually works. $250 million in real estate later, I can tell you the starting point doesn't matter. What matters is the decision to start.

You already made that decision when you bought the trilogy. You made it again when you chose the foundation track instead of pretending you didn't need it.

Two decisions most people never make. You made both.

Now here's the math on the third one:

The Foundation costs $97. Module 1 alone typically reveals $200-$800/month in money people are losing without knowing it. That's $2,400-$9,600 per year. On a $97 workbook. The Module 3 lender-ready checklist would cost you $200+ from a financial advisor. And Module 6 has helped people find forgotten retirement accounts worth five and six figures.

$97 to know where you stand. To find the money you're losing. To get a plan for changing your number.

[Get The Foundation -- $97 -->]

If the timing isn't right, that's OK. I'll keep sending you value every week. No pitch, just insights on money and wealth building.

But if you're ready to go from "I understand the problem" to "I have a plan," this is where it starts.

Every builder starts with a foundation. There's no shortcut past it. And there's no shame in being the person who does it right.

-- J. Marque

P.S. Keisha says the hardest part was sitting down with her bank statements for Module 1. "I didn't want to look at the numbers. But once I did, I found $680 a month I was throwing away. That one hour changed my life." One hour. That's all it takes.

## SEQUENCE B3 TEMPLATE MAP

| Email | Day | Template | Type | Subject |
|-------|-----|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | 0 | Premium Branded | Delivery + Track Acknowledgment | Respect -- your books are ready |
| 2 | 2 | Clean Minimal | Value Bridge (Eyes Open → Plan Needed) | Eyes open is just the beginning |
| 3 | 4 | Pure Text | Product Breakdown | 7 modules. 9 worksheets. One hour to start. |
| 4 | 7 | Clean Minimal | Soft Close + Encouragement | {first_name}, no shame in starting here |

## SEQUENCE B3 METRICS

| Email | Target Open Rate | Target CTR | Key Metric |
|-------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | 65%+ | 20%+ | Trilogy delivery + consumption |
| 2 | 40%+ | N/A | Value bridge engagement |
| 3 | 35%+ | 10%+ | THE PITCH -- $97 conversion |
| 4 | 30%+ | 8%+ | Encouragement + objection handling close |

**Target:** 8-12% of foundation track trilogy buyers who skipped the OTO page purchase The Foundation via email.
**Combined (OTO page + email):** 20-28% total conversion.
**Note:** Slightly lower conversion than the other tracks due to audience financial position. These buyers may need more time to decide. The low price point ($97) and immediate ROI from Module 1 ($200-$800/month found) are the key conversion levers.
**Price anchoring:** $97 vs $200-$800/month in wasted spending. Keisha found $680/month in Module 1 alone. Workbook pays for itself in the first hour.

## TONE NOTES FOR TRACK B3

- Warm, encouraging, mentor-like. Never condescending.
- Never "you should have done this sooner." Always "you're doing the right thing by starting now."
- Acknowledge that choosing the foundation track takes honesty and courage.
- Keisha is the primary proof point (relatable: teacher, $52K, single mom, starting from zero).
- The workbook positioned as the bridge between understanding and doing.
- Every email ends with affirmation. This audience needs to feel respected, not sold to.
