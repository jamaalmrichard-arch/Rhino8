- **Source:** https://professional.dce.harvard.edu/programs/real-estate-investments-assets-markets-and-current-trends/

## B. Insurance Education for RE Investors

### What EXISTS (Very Limited)
- **NREIG** (National Real Estate Insurance Group): Free educational content on umbrella/excess liability
- **Obie Insurance:** Blog-based education on landlord vs. umbrella policies
- **Master Passive Income:** Some insurance education in broader RE course
- **Risk & Insurance Education Alliance:** Launching CIRP designation in 2026 (5 courses, industry professional focus)

### What It COSTS
- **Umbrella policy:** ~$593/year average for landlords ($400-several thousand depending on portfolio size)
- **$1M umbrella policy:** ~$400/year base

### KEY FINDING: MASSIVE GAP HERE
- **Almost NO standalone courses** exist teaching RE investors about insurance/risk management
- Insurance education is scattered across blog posts, not packaged as courses
- No comprehensive workbook or course combines: landlord insurance, umbrella policies, entity structure, claims process, coverage gaps, lender insurance requirements
- Investors are "buying insurance" without understanding risk management strategy
- **"The old model of buying insurance is fading as owners focus on risk management, rightsizing coverage and exploring alternative risk transfer solutions"** — this shift is not reflected in available education products

---

# 4. LENDER PREPARATION / CREDIT BUILDING FOR RE

## A. Credit Repair/Optimization Courses

### Credit Consultant Association (CCA)

- **Price:** $14.99-$199.99 (Udemy sale pricing)
- **Source:** https://www.udemy.com/course/kickasscourse/

### KEY FINDING: NO PRODUCT EXISTS that teaches RE investors specifically how to:
- Build a lender-ready financial file
- Optimize credit specifically for DSCR loan qualification
- Prepare documentation packages that get loans approved faster
- Understand what lenders actually look at (beyond credit score)

## B. DSCR Loan Education (Free but Scattered)

### What Exists
- Lender websites (LendingOne, Easy Street Cap, Griffin Funding) publish free DSCR guides
- **Key requirements:** Minimum FICO 640-680, DSCR ratio 1.0-1.25 minimum, less documentation than conventional
- **DSCR loans = ~28-29% of all non-QM originations** (mid-2025 data)
- No standalone paid course teaches DSCR loan preparation comprehensively

### What Investors Need (Underserved)
- How to calculate and present DSCR to lenders
- Property-level documentation requirements
- How to improve DSCR ratio before applying
- Comparison shopping among DSCR lenders

## C. Self-Directed IRA (SDIRA) Education

### Equity Trust Company — SDIRA Courses

### SDIRA Contribution Limits (2025-2026)
- 2025: $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)
- 2026: $7,500 ($8,600 if 50+)

### KEY FINDING: SDIRA education is FREE from custodians (loss leader to attract accounts)
- No premium paid courses exist specifically for SDIRA + RE investing
- This means SDIRA content in a paid product must add significant value beyond what custodians give away

## What Separates Price Tiers

| Feature | $47 Product | $497 Product | $997+ Product |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Content depth | Surface-level / overview | Comprehensive / actionable | Deep + system-level |
| Templates/tools | 0-1 basic | 3-5 detailed | Full system/toolkit |
| Coaching | None | Group/community | Group + some 1-on-1 |
| Community | None | Forum/group | Active mastermind |
| Updates | Rarely | Periodic | Ongoing |
| Support | None | Email/forum | Direct access |
| Implementation | "Learn it" | "Do it with guidance" | "Done-with-you" |
| Credibility of creator | Unknown / beginner | Proven results | Celebrity-level guru |

## What Makes Something "Worth $1,000+"
1. **Proven system** from someone with verifiable results (not theory)
2. **Templates + tools** that save 100+ hours of work (done-for-you systems)
3. **Community/accountability** — access to other investors for deals, questions, partnerships
4. **Live coaching** — ability to ask questions and get personalized answers
5. **Ongoing updates** — market changes, new strategies, compliance updates
6. **ROI framing** — if the course helps close ONE deal, it pays for itself 10-100x

# 6. MARKET GAPS — WHERE THE MONEY IS

## GAP #1: Insurance & Risk Management for RE Investors (BIGGEST GAP)
- **Current state:** ALMOST NOTHING exists as a packaged educational product
- **What's available:** Scattered blog posts from insurance companies (NREIG, Obie), no workbooks, no courses
- **What investors need:** How to choose landlord insurance, umbrella vs. commercial policies, LLC + insurance coordination, what lenders require, claims process, when to sue vs. claim, asset protection layering
- **Opportunity:** This topic is essentially UNADDRESSED in the RE education market
- **Why it's premium:** One insurance mistake can cost $50K-$500K+. Education that prevents this is worth 10x its price.

## GAP #2: Lender File Preparation & Credit Optimization for Investors
- **Current state:** Credit repair courses exist for CONSUMERS, not RE INVESTORS
- **What's missing:** No product teaches investors how to build a "lender-ready file" — organizing financials, optimizing DTI, DSCR preparation, what documents lenders need, how to present your portfolio to banks
- **DSCR loan prep is completely unaddressed** as a standalone educational product
- **Why it's premium:** Getting approved for financing is the #1 bottleneck for scaling a RE portfolio. A $97 workbook that helps an investor qualify for a $200K loan is worth $10K+ in perceived value.

## GAP #3: Comprehensive "All Strategies" RE Workbook (Not Just One Strategy)
- **Current state:** Courses teach ONE thing — wholesaling OR BRRRR OR flipping OR sub-to
- **What's missing:** No single workbook covers ALL exit strategies with analysis tools for each
- **The investor who knows wholesale, BRRRR, sub-to, seller finance, wrap, lease option, AND flip has 7x more options on every deal**
- **Most expensive courses ($5K-$50K) only teach 1-2 strategies**

## GAP #4: Risk Management Across the Entire Investment Lifecycle
- **Current state:** Entity formation (LLC) is taught, but the REST of risk management is ignored
- **What's missing:** Insurance, contracts, compliance, tenant screening risk, environmental risk, climate risk, market risk assessment — as a SYSTEM
- **Climate/catastrophe risk** is newly urgent (2024-2025 record losses) and NOT in any RE course

## GAP #5: SDIRA + Creative Finance Integration
- **Current state:** SDIRA education is free (from custodians) but surface-level. Creative finance courses ($8K-$19K) don't cover SDIRA.
- **What's missing:** How to combine SDIRA with sub-to, seller finance, private lending — advanced wealth-building strategies
- **This is retirement money education — emotional and high-stakes**

## GAP #6: Financial Literacy SPECIFICALLY for RE Investors
- **Current state:** Personal finance courses (Ramsey, Ramit) are for W-2 employees. RE courses assume financial literacy.
- **What's missing:** A product that teaches money management, tax strategy, entity structure, and investing — specifically for someone building a RE portfolio
- **The bridge between "financial literacy" and "RE investing" doesn't exist as a product**

---

# 7. WHAT A "$10K WORTH OF VALUE" CLAIM NEEDS

For a workbook/course to credibly claim "$10,000 worth of value," it must contain:

## Content Depth Equal to Multiple Premium Courses
- Must cover what $5K-$8K wholesaling courses cover (deal finding, analysis, negotiation)
- Must cover what $8K-$19K creative finance courses cover (sub-to, seller finance, wraps)
- Must cover what $30K-$50K comprehensive programs cover (systems, scaling, team building)
- If your single product replaces 2-3 premium courses, the math works: 2 x $5,000 = $10,000

## Actionable Tools & Templates
- Not just theory — fillable worksheets, calculators, checklists, scripts, contract templates
- Every chapter should produce a usable OUTPUT (completed worksheet, filled template, action plan)
- Deal analyzers, lender prep checklists, insurance comparison tools, entity structure flowcharts

## Topics That Are Otherwise $500-$5,000+ to Learn
- Asset protection strategies (Anderson charges undisclosed premium for this)
- Tax strategy (CPAs charge $300-$500/hr for this knowledge)
- Insurance optimization (insurance brokers don't teach this — they sell)
- Lender preparation (loan officers don't teach this — they approve or deny)
- Creative finance structures (Pace Morby charges $8K-$19K for this)

## Credibility Markers
- Author must have verifiable real-world results (not theory)
- Specific dollar amounts, deal counts, markets
- Anonymous is fine IF the content depth proves expertise (Pipeline Mastery model)
- Social proof: testimonials, case studies, before/after numbers

## Unique Combinations Not Available Elsewhere
- The $10K value claim is MOST credible when the product covers topics that DON'T EXIST as standalone products
- Insurance + risk management + lender prep + all RE strategies + financial literacy = currently priced at $0 because NOBODY SELLS IT
- The absence of competition means you can set the value anchor

# 8. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE SUMMARY

## Price-to-Content Map

| Product Type | Typical Price | Content Hours | Templates | Coaching | Community |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Etsy template | $5-$25 | 0 | 1 | No | No |
| Amazon RE book | $15-$30 | 4-8 hr read | 0-2 | No | No |
| Udemy course | $15-$30 (sale) | 4-12 hrs video | 2-5 | No | No |

| BP Bootcamp | $199-$515 | 4-6 weeks | Some | Group | BP forum |
| Gumroad course | $50-$150 | 2-10 hrs | Varies | No | No |
| Mid-tier course | $397-$2,495 | 10-40 hrs | 5-10 | Group calls | Private group |
| Premium mentorship | $5,000-$8,000 | 20-100+ hrs | Full toolkit | Weekly calls | Private community |
| Elite program | $10,000-$50,000 | Unlimited | Full system | 1-on-1 | Mastermind |

## The Market Whitespace

The RE education market is SATURATED at two extremes:
1. **Free/cheap:** YouTube, blogs, $15-$30 Udemy courses, Etsy templates
2. **Premium guru courses:** $5,000-$50,000 mentorship programs

**The $47-$297 range for PHYSICAL/DIGITAL WORKBOOKS is dramatically underserved.**

There is no comprehensive RE investing workbook that:
- Covers ALL strategies (wholesale, BRRRR, sub-to, seller finance, flip, wrap, lease option)
- Includes risk management and insurance education
- Teaches lender file preparation
- Includes fillable templates and calculators
- Provides financial literacy foundations for RE investors
- Sells for under $500

**This is the gap. This is where a workbook product wins.**
