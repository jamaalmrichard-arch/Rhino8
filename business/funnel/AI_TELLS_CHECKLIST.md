# AI WRITING TELLS — COMPLETE AUDIT CHECKLIST

> **Purpose:** Use this checklist to audit and clean any sales copy, marketing content, emails, landing pages, course material, or ebook text so it reads as authentically human. Every pattern below is documented from AI detection tools (GPTZero, Originality.ai, Turnitin), Wikipedia's Signs of AI Writing guide, copywriters, academic researchers, and public discussion forums as of early 2026.

> **How to use:** Run your content through each section. Ctrl+F the flagged words/phrases. Replace or restructure using the human alternatives provided. Not every instance is a death sentence — it is the *clustering* of multiple tells that triggers detection. Three or more tells in the same paragraph = rewrite that paragraph.

## 1. WORD-LEVEL TELLS

### 1A. The "Instant Red Flag" Words
These words have been statistically measured to appear 10x-269x more often in AI text than in human writing (per GPTZero's corpus of 3.3M documents).

### 2C. AI Filler Phrases (Delete Entirely)

These phrases add zero information. Cut them.

- "I understand this can feel overwhelming"
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "This is where things get interesting"
- "Let me break this down for you"
- "Think of it this way"
- "The good news is"

### 2D. Trailing Significance Clauses (AI Habit of Tacking on Vague Importance)

AI frequently adds a trailing clause to sentences that makes vague claims about importance. These add no information and flag AI instantly.

**AI pattern:**
> "The program was launched in 2019, **emphasizing the importance of community engagement.**"

**Human version:**
> "The program launched in 2019." (Period. Done. If community engagement matters, explain how in the next sentence with specifics.)

More examples to catch and kill:
- "...reflecting the continued relevance of..."
- "...highlighting the need for..."
- "...underscoring the significance of..."
- "...demonstrating the power of..."
- "...showcasing the potential of..."
- "...emphasizing the importance of..."
- "...illustrating the impact of..."

## 3. STRUCTURAL TELLS

### 3A. Paragraph and Section Structure

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Uniform paragraph length | Every paragraph is 2-3 sentences, same approximate length. | **Vary intentionally.** One paragraph can be a single sentence. The next can be five. Let the content dictate length, not a template. |
| Perfect symmetry in lists | Every bullet point is the same length. Always 3 or 5 items. | **Break the pattern.** Use 4 or 7 items. Make one bullet long and the next short. Let some be fragments. |
| Hourglass structure | Opens with a synthesis, narrows to details, ends with another synthesis. Every section wraps up neatly. | **Don't wrap up every section.** Let some sections flow into the next without a bow on top. End mid-thought sometimes. |
| Every section has a conclusion | AI can't resist summarizing at the end of each section. | **Cut section summaries.** If you've made your point, move on. The reader doesn't need you to re-explain what they just read. |
| "First... Second... Third..." | Numbered reasoning in every argument. | **Drop the numbering.** Use "and" or "also" or just start the next point. Numbering is fine occasionally, not every time. |
| Heading for everything | AI over-organizes with excessive H2/H3 headers. | **Reduce headers by 30-50%.** Let some content flow under a broader header. Not every idea needs its own section. |
| Introduction announces what's coming | "In this guide, we'll cover X, Y, and Z." | **Skip the table of contents.** Just start with your strongest point. |
| Conclusion restates everything | AI conclusions repeat the entire article in compressed form. | **End with a single strong takeaway or call to action.** Don't rehash. |
| Starts with "Overall" or "In conclusion" | AI's default conclusion starters. | "Here's what matters..." or "So..." or just make your closing point without announcing it. |

### 3B. List and Bullet Point Structure

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Perfect parallel structure | Every bullet starts with the same part of speech. | **Break parallelism intentionally.** Start one bullet with a verb, the next with a noun, the next with "You..." |
| Colon before every list | AI always introduces lists with a colon. | **Sometimes just flow into the list naturally.** Or use "like" or "such as" and keep it in the sentence. |
| Bold + explanation format | Every bullet is **Bold Term** — then explanation. | **Mix it up.** Some bullets bold, some not. Some with dashes, some without. |
| Excessive bullet points | AI defaults to bullets for everything. | **Use paragraphs.** Bullets are for scannable lists, not for making every idea look organized. |
| Groups of three (tricolon) | AI groups ideas in threes for rhythm. | **Use 2 or 4.** Or 7. Break the rhythm. |

### 3C. Heading Level Issues

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Skipping heading levels | AI sometimes jumps from H1 to H3, skipping H2. | **Use proper heading hierarchy.** H1 > H2 > H3. |
| Title-casing all headings | AI capitalizes every main word in every heading. | **Use sentence case for subheadings.** Only H1 needs title case. "How to close your first deal" not "How To Close Your First Deal." |
| Overly descriptive headers | Every header is a full clause. "Understanding the Power of Leveraging Real Estate for Generational Wealth." | **Keep headers short and punchy.** "The Real Estate Play" or "Why Rentals Win." |

---

## 4. TONE AND VOICE TELLS

### 4A. Fake Balance and Hedging

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Both-sides-ism | "On one hand... on the other hand..." on every topic. AI never takes a hard stance. | **Pick a side.** Have an opinion. "This is the better option because..." Real people have positions. |
| Excessive qualifiers | "It could potentially help you possibly achieve..." | **Be direct.** "This will help you get..." |
| Hedging where unnecessary | "It's generally considered to be a good practice..." | **State it.** "Do this." or "This works." |
| Disclaimers nobody asked for | "Of course, results may vary and this isn't financial advice..." | **If you need a disclaimer, put it at the bottom once.** Don't pepper it throughout. |
| "While it's true that [concession], [main point]" | AI gives ground before every point. | **Lead with your point.** Concede only when it actually strengthens your argument. |

### 4B. Artificial Empathy and Motivation

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| "I understand this can feel overwhelming" | AI faking empathy it doesn't have. | **Share a real experience.** "I remember staring at 47 properties on a spreadsheet wondering where to start." |
| "You're not alone in this" | Generic AI comfort. | **Be specific.** "Every wholesaler I know hit this wall in month 3." |
| "You've got this!" | AI cheerleading. | **Skip the pep talk.** Give them the next step instead. "Here's your move..." |
| Generic motivational closings | "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." | **End with a specific action.** "Pull three comps tonight. That's it." |
| "Remember, every expert was once a beginner" | AI platitude. | **Tell a real story** about someone who started with nothing. Or just cut it. |
| Excessive exclamation marks in motivation | "You can do this! Start today! The future is bright!" | **Calm down.** One exclamation mark per page max. Let the content create urgency. |

### 4C. Tone Uniformity

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Same tone throughout | AI maintains a single register from start to finish — never speeds up, slows down, gets frustrated, or gets excited. | **Let your tone shift.** Get fired up in one paragraph. Get dead serious in the next. Drop a one-word sentence. "Done." |
| Never swears or uses slang | AI keeps everything G-rated corporate. | **Use your natural voice.** If you'd say "that deal was trash" in real life, write it that way. |
| Overly formal (no contractions) | "It is important that you do not..." | **Use contractions.** "Don't do this" not "Do not do this." "You'll" not "You will." "Here's" not "Here is." |
| Perfect grammar everywhere | Every sentence is grammatically flawless. | **Break grammar rules on purpose sometimes.** Fragments. Starting with "And." Ending with prepositions. That's how people actually write. |
| No personality quirks | AI has no tics, catchphrases, or voice signature. | **Develop 2-3 signature phrases or patterns.** Something only you would say. Repeat them across content. |
| People-pleasing tone | AI tries to be helpful and agreeable about everything. | **Disagree with something.** Call out a bad practice. Have a take that not everyone will love. |

---

## 5. CONTENT TELLS

### 5A. Vagueness and Generic Content

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Vague examples | "For example, a business might increase revenue by optimizing their processes." | **Use specific numbers and names.** "I closed a 4-unit in College Park for $176K. After reno, it appraised at $260K." |
| Generic scenarios | "Imagine you're a first-time homebuyer looking for your dream home." | **Use a real scenario.** "Last Tuesday, a guy DM'd me: 'I've got $8K saved. Can I buy a rental?'" |
| Overly comprehensive coverage | AI tries to cover every angle of every topic in one piece. | **Go deep on one thing.** It's better to nail one concept than skim fifteen. |
| No personal experiences | AI can't share real stories because it doesn't have any. | **Share your actual experiences.** Wins, losses, embarrassing moments. Specificity = credibility. |
| Hypothetical over real | "Consider a scenario where..." | **Use "Here's what actually happened..."** Real stories beat hypotheticals every time. |
| 60-70% of names are Emily or Sarah | AI defaults to the most common names when making up examples. | **Use varied, specific names.** Or better yet, use real people (with permission) or no names at all. |
| Avoids proper nouns | AI gives generic descriptions instead of naming specific tools, places, brands. | **Name names.** "PropStream" not "a property data tool." "Atlanta" not "a major metro area." |

### 5B. Content Structure Issues

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Restating the prompt | AI opens by rephrasing your question back to you. "Great question! When it comes to..." | **Cut the restatement.** Start with the answer. |
| Covering both sides equally | AI gives equal weight to pros and cons even when one side is clearly better. | **Weight your content.** If something is 80% good, spend 80% on why it's good and 20% on caveats. |
| Summary + list + summary pattern | Opens with a paragraph summary, gives a bulleted list, closes with another paragraph summary. | **Pick one format.** Either summarize in prose or give a list. Don't do both. |
| Excessive "for example" usage | AI over-signals its examples. | **Just give the example.** You don't need to announce it. |
| Every claim is supported | AI provides support for obvious statements. | **Let some things stand on their own.** "Deals fall apart all the time." Doesn't need a stat. Your reader already knows this. |

---

## 6. PUNCTUATION AND FORMATTING TELLS

### 6A. Em Dash Overuse (The Biggest Punctuation Tell)

**The data:** One-third of all AI-generated sentences contain em dashes. In human writing, they appear once per paragraph or less. Em dash usage doubled from 2021 to 2025. GPT-4o used 10x more em dashes than GPT-3.5.

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Em dashes everywhere | "The property — a 4-unit in Decatur — was listed at $180K — well below market." | **Use commas, parentheses, colons, or periods instead.** Limit yourself to 1-2 em dashes per page max. |
| Em dashes replacing commas | "The seller, who was motivated — wanted to close fast." | **Use a comma.** "The seller, who was motivated, wanted to close fast." |
| Em dashes replacing parentheses | "The property — built in 1987 — needed a new roof." | **Use parentheses or commas.** "The property (built in 1987) needed a new roof." |
| Em dashes for dramatic pause | "And then — everything changed." | **Use a period and a new sentence.** "And then everything changed." Or use an ellipsis if you want drama. |

### 6B. Other Punctuation Patterns

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Oxford comma every time | AI uses the Oxford comma in every list. | **Drop it sometimes.** "Fix, flip and hold" reads more casual than "Fix, flip, and hold." Not a hard rule — just vary it. |
| Semicolons (varies by model) | GPT-5 overuses semicolons. Earlier models avoided them. | **Use semicolons only where a period feels too hard and a comma feels too weak.** Maybe 1-2 per article. |
| Excessive quotation marks for emphasis | AI puts "quotation marks" around terms to signal "special meaning." | **Use italics sparingly or just let the word stand.** "The deal was a homerun" not "The deal was a 'homerun.'" |
| Perfectly matched punctuation | Every dash, comma, and period is textbook correct. | **A misplaced comma or imperfect punctuation occasionally reads as human.** Not wrong — just natural. |
| Colon before every elaboration | "Here's the thing: [explanation]." | **Vary your intro punctuation.** Sometimes use a period. Sometimes a dash. Sometimes no intro at all. |

### 6C. Formatting Patterns

| AI Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Excessive bold for emphasis | AI bolds **every important phrase** in **every paragraph.** | **Bold only 1-2 things per page.** If everything is bold, nothing is bold. |
| Consistent paragraph spacing | Every paragraph is the same visual length. | **Vary paragraph lengths visually.** Some paragraphs are one sentence. Some are six. |
| Markdown headers in everything | AI defaults to H2/H3 headers, bullet points, and bold as a template. | **Write in flowing prose sometimes.** Not everything needs to be an organized list. |
| ChatGPT title-cases all headers | "How To Build Generational Wealth Through Strategic Real Estate Investment" | **Sentence case.** "How to build generational wealth through real estate." |
| American English only | AI defaults to American spelling/grammar exclusively. | **Not a problem if you're American, but be aware.** If targeting international audiences, this uniformity can flag. |

---

## 7. CLAUDE-SPECIFIC TELLS

Claude (Anthropic) has its own distinct patterns compared to ChatGPT:

| Claude Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Paragraph-heavy output | Claude leans toward long, flowing paragraphs rather than bullet points. | **Mix short and long paragraphs.** Add line breaks where a reader would pause. |
| Introspective, poetic tone | Claude sounds "writerly" — philosophical, reflective, nuanced. | **Be blunter.** Real sales copy is direct: "This makes you money" not "This invites you to consider new possibilities." |
| Convergent synthesis | Claude takes messy ideas and synthesizes them into a clean narrative. Too clean. | **Leave some mess.** Real writing has rough edges, tangents, and incomplete thoughts. |
| Overly warm and emotionally aware | Claude defaults to empathetic, kind, understanding tone. | **Match your actual personality.** Be gruff if you're gruff. Be funny if you're funny. |
| Hedging with nuance | Claude over-qualifies statements. "While this approach has merit, there are important nuances to consider..." | **Be definitive.** "This works." or "This doesn't work." |
| Apologetic patterns | Claude tends toward "I appreciate..." and "That's a great point..." | **Remove all meta-commentary about the conversation.** Just deliver the content. |

---

## 8. CHATGPT-SPECIFIC TELLS

| ChatGPT Pattern | What to Look For | Human Fix |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Structured creativity with hooks | Opens with a metaphor or hook, then shifts to organized sections. | **If you use a hook, make it a real story, not a manufactured opening.** |
| Heavy markdown formatting | Excessive headings, bold, bullet points, numbered lists. | **Reduce formatting by 50%.** Use prose. |
| Em dash addiction | The most documented punctuation tell. | **See Section 6A.** |
| Exclamation point clusters | "Great question! Here's what you need to know!" | **Cut exclamation points to 1 per page max in professional copy.** |
| Numbered list for everything | ChatGPT defaults to "1. 2. 3. 4. 5." organization. | **Use prose or a mix.** Not everything needs to be enumerated. |
| Oxford comma religious usage | Uses it in every single list, including headlines. | **Drop it in casual contexts.** |
| Groups of three | ChatGPT organizes ideas into tricolons (three items) for rhythm. | **Use 2 or 4 or 7 items.** |
| "Great question!" opener | ChatGPT's knee-jerk response to questions. | **Delete. Just answer.** |
| "Absolutely!" agreement | ChatGPT's default affirmative. | **Use "Yes" or "Right" or just make your point.** |

## 9. DETECTION METRICS EXPLAINED

Understanding how detection tools work helps you beat them:

### 9A. Perplexity (How Predictable Is Your Text?)

- **What it measures:** How easily a language model can predict the next word in your text.
- **AI text:** Low perplexity (5-10). The text is exactly what a model would predict.
- **Human text:** Higher perplexity (20-50). Humans make unexpected word choices.
- **How to fix:** Use unexpected word choices. Throw in a word that doesn't statistically "belong" but makes sense in context. "That deal was filthy" instead of "That deal was excellent."

### 9B. Burstiness (How Varied Are Your Sentences?)

- **What it measures:** Variation in sentence length and structure.
- **AI text:** Low burstiness. Sentences are all similar length and structure.
- **Human text:** High burstiness. Mix of 4-word sentences and 30-word sentences.
- **How to fix:** Intentionally vary sentence length. Short. Then long and winding with multiple clauses that stack up before you get to the point. Then medium. Then one word. Done.

### 9C. Stylistic Uniformity

- **What it measures:** Whether tone, vocabulary, and cadence stay the same throughout.
- **AI text:** Flat, uniform style from start to finish.
- **Human text:** Shifts in energy, formality, pace.
- **How to fix:** Change gears. Be formal in one section, conversational in the next. Let emotion creep in. Write one paragraph like you're talking to your best friend.

> "The market's weird right now. Rates are up, inventory is low, and every wholesaler I know is fighting over the same 200 leads. But there's money on the table if you know where to look. Let me show you what's working in Atlanta this month."

**AI version:**
> "It's worth noting that the significance of building strong relationships with motivated sellers cannot be overstated. Furthermore, employing a holistic approach to lead generation — one that encompasses both digital and traditional marketing strategies — is paramount to achieving sustainable success in this competitive arena."

**Human version:**
> "Talk to sellers like people. That's it. The follow-up system I built does 13 touches over 90 days — calls, texts, voicemails, handwritten mail. Most wholesalers quit after touch 3. I close deals on touch 9."

### The 10-Point Human Edit Pass

Run every piece of content through these 10 checks:

1. **Ctrl+F the kill list.** Search for: delve, landscape, tapestry, robust, leverage, multifaceted, navigate, holistic, comprehensive, pivotal, showcase, seamless, paramount, realm, foster, empower, embark. Replace or delete every hit.
2. **Count your em dashes.** More than 2 per page? Replace most with commas, periods, or parentheses.
3. **Check paragraph lengths.** If they're all the same length, rewrite some short and some long.
4. **Read it out loud.** If you stumble, the reader will stumble. If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it.
5. **Add one real story or specific number per section.** "I closed 12 deals last year" beats "investors can close multiple deals."
6. **Cut every sentence that restates the previous one.** AI loves to rephrase the same point.
7. **Remove all meta-commentary.** "In this guide, we'll explore..." — delete. "Let's dive in..." — delete. "As mentioned above..." — delete.
8. **Break one grammar rule per page.** Start a sentence with "And." Use a fragment. End with a preposition. Real people do this.
9. **Delete motivational fluff.** "You've got this!" and "The future is bright!" add nothing. Replace with specific next steps.
10. **Vary your transitions.** If you used "However" in one section, use "But" or "Still" or "That said" in the next. Never use "Furthermore" or "Moreover" — ever.
