## DETAILED PLATFORM ANALYSIS

---

### 1. GoHighLevel (GHL) Communities — ALREADY PAYING FOR IT

**Cost:** $0 additional (included in all GHL plans, including the $97/mo Starter plan)

**What it is:** A built-in community feature inside GoHighLevel that lets you create groups, post content, run discussions, and host courses/memberships -- all within the same ecosystem as your CRM, email marketing, funnels, calendar, and payments.

#### Features
- **Groups & Channels:** Create multiple groups within a single community. Segment by topic (e.g., "Weekly Calls," "Deal Analysis," "Mindset," "Resources")
- **Post Types:** Text posts, images, video, polls, and file attachments
- **Live Video:** Built-in live streaming for Q&As, coaching calls, workshops -- no Zoom needed
- **Courses Integration:** Course Studio 2.0 lets you build courses alongside the community. Members can access lessons, track progress, and earn completions
- **Gamification:** Leaderboard system with customizable levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold). Points for posting, engagement, course completion. Rewards can include course access, discounts, or exclusive roles
- **Member Roles:** Admin (full control), Contributor (limited permissions), Member (basic access)
- **Branding:** Upload logo, cover image, favicon. Adjust layout and visual elements. Theme customization available
- **Mobile App:** LeadConnector app (iOS + Android). Members can access community on mobile
- **Event Calendar:** Schedule live calls, group sessions, office hours
- **Workflows & Automation:** Trigger actions when members complete courses, submit forms, or hit milestones. Auto-assign tags, send emails, move through pipelines
- **Payments:** Charge for membership access directly through GHL. Stripe/PayPal integration
- **Email Integration:** Newsletter summaries of group posts. Automated drip sequences
- **Search:** Members can search posts and content within the community

#### Limitations (Honest Assessment)
- **Mobile posting has been inconsistent:** Some users report the mobile app does not allow posting in communities (desktop works fine). This has been a reported issue on the GHL ideas board. Check current status before launch
- **Community UX is more "forum" than "social feed":** Compared to Skool's gamified, social-media-style feed, GHL feels more like a structured forum with posts and replies. Less "fun," more "functional"
- **Newsletter template customization is limited:** The auto-generated newsletter summarizing posts is not fully editable for branding consistency
- **No native gamification leaderboard on par with Skool's:** Gamification exists but is newer and less polished
- **Learning curve:** GHL is powerful but complex. Students who are not tech-savvy may need onboarding help to navigate the platform

#### Why GHL Wins for This Use Case
1. **You already pay for it.** $0 additional cost
2. **Everything in one place.** CRM, email, SMS, funnels, payments, calendar, community, courses -- one login, one ecosystem
3. **Payment gating built in.** Charge $5,997, student gets auto-enrolled into the community + course. No third-party payment gateway needed
4. **Automation power.** When a student pays, GHL can: add them to the community, enroll them in the course, tag them in the CRM, trigger a welcome email sequence, book their onboarding call -- all automatically
5. **Live video built in.** No Zoom subscription needed for group calls
6. **Course delivery built in.** Course Studio 2.0 handles modules, lessons, video hosting, completion tracking
7. **Scalable.** When you go from 15 students to 50 to 200, the infrastructure is already there

#### Professional Appearance Rating: 7/10
- Clean enough for a $5,997 program. Not as sleek as Circle or Mighty Networks, but with proper branding (logo, cover image, organized groups), it looks professional
- The gold/black aesthetic can be achieved with cover images and branding assets

---

### 2. Discord — BEST FREE STANDALONE OPTION

**Cost:** $0 (free forever for unlimited members, channels, roles, voice/video)

#### Features
- **Channels & Categories:** Unlimited text and voice channels organized into categories (e.g., "COACHING CALLS" category with #week-1, #week-2, etc.)
- **Threads:** Threaded conversations inside channels for focused discussions
- **Voice & Video:** Free voice channels, video calls, screen sharing, Go Live streaming
- **Roles & Permissions:** Granular role system. Create "Student," "Alumni," "Coach" roles with specific permissions per channel
- **Bots:** Thousands of free bots for moderation, welcome messages, analytics, reaction roles, auto-posting
- **Search:** Full message search across all channels
- **File Sharing:** 10MB per file on free tier (limiting for large PDFs, videos)
- **Mobile App:** Excellent mobile app (iOS + Android). Real-time notifications
- **Stage Channels:** Podcast/webinar-style audio rooms
- **Forums:** Forum-style channels for organized Q&A discussions

#### Gating Access (Paid Members Only)
Discord is free but does NOT have built-in payment gating. Options:
- **Manual:** Generate a private invite link, only share with paid students
- **Whop:** Free platform (takes a % of sales) that manages payments + auto-grants Discord access
- **LaunchPass:** $29/mo + 3.5% transaction fee. Auto-manages subscriptions and Discord access
- **Manual + GHL:** Process payment in GHL, manually add students to Discord server. Simple for 15 students

#### Limitations
- **No built-in payment processing.** Need third-party tools or manual management
- **No email capture.** Discord does not give you member emails -- you lose ownership of the relationship
- **Gamer stigma.** Discord's brand is associated with gaming. Some coaching students may find it unprofessional
- **Can feel overwhelming.** Too many channels, pings, and features can confuse non-tech-savvy users
- **10MB file limit.** Cannot share large documents or videos natively (use Google Drive links instead)
- **No built-in course hosting.** Need external tool for structured learning content

#### Professional Appearance: 5/10
- With server boosts ($4.99/mo per boost, need 2-7 for features), you unlock custom banners, HD streaming, larger file uploads
- Custom bots, organized channels, and proper branding can make it look professional -- but it will never look like a premium coaching portal
- The interface screams "gaming/tech" not "premium wealth building"

#### Best For
- Communities that are heavy on real-time chat, voice calls, and casual interaction
- Tech-savvy student base that already uses Discord
- FREE with no compromises on communication features

---

### 3. Telegram — FAST, FREE, GLOBAL

**Cost:** $0

#### Features
- **Supergroups:** Up to 200,000 members, with topic-based threads (similar to channels)
- **Channels:** One-way broadcast to unlimited subscribers (announcements)
- **Voice/Video Calls:** Group calls up to 200 participants with screen sharing
- **File Sharing:** 2GB per file (best in class for free platforms)
- **Bots:** Custom bots for automation, polls, scheduling, payments
- **Pinned Messages:** Pin important resources at the top of groups
- **Search:** Full message and file search
- **Privacy:** End-to-end encryption available, no ads, no data selling
- **Mobile App:** Excellent (iOS, Android, desktop, web -- syncs across all)

#### Gating Access
- **Private group + invite link:** Simple. Only share the link with paid students
- **InviteMember bot:** Manages paid subscriptions and auto-grants/revokes access
- **LaunchPass:** Also supports Telegram gating

#### Limitations
- **Minimal branding.** Group photo and description only. No logos, cover images, color themes, or custom layouts
- **No courses.** Zero course/lesson structure. Just messages in a chat
- **Looks like a messaging app, not a coaching portal.** Because it IS a messaging app
- **No organization beyond topics.** Cannot create the structured "module 1, lesson 3" experience
- **Spam risk.** Telegram is notorious for crypto/spam bots. Moderation is manual
- **No member directory.** Cannot see all members and their profiles easily

#### Professional Appearance: 4/10
- It is a chat app. No matter how you brand it, a $5,997 student opening Telegram and seeing a group chat does not scream "premium coaching experience"
- Works well as a supplementary communication channel (quick updates, accountability check-ins) but NOT as the primary community hub

---

### 4. Facebook Groups — FAMILIAR BUT DECLINING

**Cost:** $0

#### Features
- **Posts, comments, reactions:** Standard social media feed
- **Topics/Units:** Organize posts by topic. "Units" feature for course-like content
- **Files/Docs:** Upload files, create collaborative docs
- **Live Video:** Facebook Live built in
- **Events:** Schedule and manage events with RSVPs
- **Membership Questions:** Screen new members with entry questions
- **Mobile App:** Universal (everyone has Facebook)
- **Search:** Full post and comment search

#### Limitations
- **Privacy nightmare.** Facebook collects data on everything. Students may not want their coaching participation visible to Facebook's ad network
- **Algorithm interference.** Facebook decides what posts members see. Important announcements can get buried
- **No payment gating built in.** Need MemberSpace ($25/mo+) or manual approval
- **Ad distractions.** Members see ads and other content while in the app
- **Declining demographics.** Younger audiences (25-35) are leaving Facebook
- **You do not own the platform.** Facebook can shut down groups, change rules, or throttle reach at any time
- **Professional perception:** A Facebook Group feels free and casual, not like a $5,997 premium experience

#### Professional Appearance: 5/10
- Everyone knows what a Facebook Group looks like. It does not feel exclusive or premium
- The association with "free Facebook groups" undermines the perceived value of a $5,997 program

---

### 5. WhatsApp Communities — TOO CASUAL

**Cost:** $0

#### Features
- **Communities umbrella:** Organize multiple groups under one community (up to 5,000 members in announcement group)
- **Group chats:** Up to 1,024 members per group
- **Voice/Video calls:** Group calls supported
- **File sharing:** Photos, videos, documents
- **Universal adoption:** Everyone has WhatsApp
- **Member tags:** Assign roles like "Coach" in different groups (new 2026 feature)
- **Message history:** New members can now see recent chat history

#### Limitations
- **Zero branding.** No logos, no cover images, no themes. It is a messaging app
- **No content organization.** Messages scroll infinitely. No threads, no topics (beyond separate groups)
- **No file management.** Shared files disappear into the chat scroll
- **No courses.** No structured learning content
- **No search** worth using for educational content
- **Phone number exposed.** All members see each other's phone numbers -- privacy issue for a coaching program
- **Feels like texting.** A $5,997 student should not feel like they joined a group text chain

#### Professional Appearance: 3/10
- Completely inappropriate as a primary platform for a premium coaching program. Acceptable ONLY as a supplementary quick-communication tool (like a "study group" text chain alongside the main platform)

---

### 6. Slack — CRIPPLED FREE TIER

**Cost:** $0 (free tier) / $7.25/mo per user for Pro

#### Features (Free Tier)
- **Channels:** Unlimited channels and users
- **Threads:** Threaded conversations (excellent for organized discussion)
- **Search:** Full search (but only last 90 days of messages)
- **Integrations:** Up to 10 third-party apps
- **File sharing:** 5GB total across all users

#### Limitations (Free Tier)
- **90-day message history.** After 90 days, messages are hidden. After 1 year, permanently deleted. For a 6-month program, students lose access to early content before the program ends
- **5GB storage total.** Shared across ALL users. One video upload and you are done
- **1:1 calls only.** No group voice or video calls on free tier. This is a dealbreaker for coaching
- **10 app integrations.** Very limiting
- **No courses.** No structured content delivery
- **Looks corporate, not coaching.** Slack screams "office tool" not "wealth building community"

#### Professional Appearance: 7/10
- Slack looks professional but feels like a workplace, not a coaching community. The free tier limitations make it impractical for a 6-month program

#### Verdict: NOT VIABLE
The 90-day message deletion and 1:1-only calls on the free tier make Slack unusable for a 6-month coaching program. The paid tier ($7.25/user/mo x 15 students = $109/mo) defeats the "free" requirement.

---

### 7. Geneva (Now BFF by Bumble) — DEAD FOR THIS USE CASE

**Cost:** Was free

#### What Happened
Geneva was acquired by Bumble and rebranded as "BFF: Make Friends. By Bumble." The standalone Geneva app has been shut down. The platform is now focused on friendship/social discovery, NOT business communities or coaching.

#### Verdict: NOT VIABLE
Do not build a $5,997 coaching community on a platform that just pivoted to a dating company's friend-finding app. Zero business credibility.

---

### 8. Heartbeat — NOT FREE

**Cost:** $29/mo minimum (Starter plan). No free tier. 14-day trial only.

- Beautiful platform, excellent for communities. Full white-label branding, courses, events, payments
- But it costs money, so it fails the "free" requirement
- Communities inactive for 30 days after trial are automatically DELETED

#### Verdict: ELIMINATED (not free)

---

### 9. Circle — NOT FREE

**Cost:** $49/mo minimum (Basic plan). No free tier. 14-day trial only.

- Premium community platform used by top creators. Spaces, topics, courses, events, live streams
- Transaction fees of 2-4% on top of subscription
- But it costs $49-$99/mo, so it fails the "free" requirement

#### Verdict: ELIMINATED (not free)

---

### 10. Mighty Networks — NOT FREE

**Cost:** $49/mo minimum (Community plan). No free tier. 14-day trial only.

- Branded mobile app, courses, events, community, payments all in one
- But it costs $49+/mo plus transaction fees, so it fails the "free" requirement

#### Verdict: ELIMINATED (not free)

---

### Step 5: Schedule Recurring Events

### Step 7: Branding & Aesthetic
To achieve the gold/black premium look:
- **Cover images:** Create in Canva. Black background, gold text/accents, professional typography
- **Logo:** Gold monogram or wordmark on black/dark background
- **Group icons:** Consistent gold icons for each group

### Step 8: Student Onboarding Checklist

- [ ] Login credentials (email + password)
- [ ] "How to access your portal" video (2 min walkthrough)
- [ ] Community guidelines / code of conduct
- [ ] Schedule of all live calls for the cohort
- [ ] Telegram group invite link
- [ ] First action item (introduce yourself in the community)

---

| GoHighLevel (already paying) | $97/mo (existing) |
| Community feature | $0 (included) |
| Course hosting | $0 (included) |
| Live video calls | $0 (included) |
| Email/SMS marketing | Usage-based (pennies per message) |
| Telegram (supplementary) | $0 |

---

## BOTTOM LINE

Do not pay for a separate community platform. GHL already does everything you need. It is not the prettiest community tool in the market, but it is the smartest business decision because:

1. **Zero additional cost** -- you already pay $97/mo
2. **One ecosystem** -- payments, CRM, email, SMS, community, courses, calendar, live video all connected
3. **Automation** -- no other free platform can auto-enroll students, trigger email sequences, track engagement, and manage your pipeline simultaneously
4. **You own the data** -- member emails, engagement history, payment records all in your CRM
5. **Scales with you** -- from 15 students to 150 without switching platforms

Use Telegram as the informal "group chat" layer for quick daily interaction. Everything structured and valuable lives in GHL.
