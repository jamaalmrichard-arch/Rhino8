## EMAIL 1 — Day 0 (Immediate after download)

**Subject:** You just took the red pill on money
**Preview text:** Welcome to the other side.

---

{first_name},

You just did something 95% of people never will — you went looking for the truth about money.

Most people go their entire lives without understanding why everything costs more, why they work harder than their parents but have less, or why the rules seem rigged.

You're about to find out why.

I'm J. Marque. I've closed over $250 million in real estate — as a wholesaler, flipper, landlord, title company owner, and consultant. I'm also a Marine Corps veteran. And the biggest lesson I ever learned wasn't in a boardroom or on a battlefield.

It was this: **the money system wasn't built for you.** But once you see how it works, you can use it.

That's what Book 1 is about.

Start reading now — especially Chapter 3. That's where it clicks.

[Read Book 1 now →]

Over the next few days, I'm going to share some things about money that changed the way I see everything. Things I wish someone had told me 20 years ago.

Talk soon,
— J. Marque

P.S. If you only read one chapter tonight, make it the one about 1971. You'll never look at the dollar the same way again.

## EMAIL 2 — Day 1

**Subject:** What happened on August 15, 1971
**Preview text:** One Sunday night changed everything.

---

{first_name},

On a Sunday night in August 1971, President Nixon went on live television and made an announcement that changed money forever.

He said it was "temporary."

It's been 55 years.

Before that night, every dollar was backed by real gold sitting in a vault. After that night, the dollar was backed by... nothing. Just a promise from the government.

And here's what happened next:

- A house that cost $25,000 in 1971 costs $420,000 today
- A gallon of gas went from $0.36 to $3.50
- College tuition went from $500/year to $25,000/year
- $1 in 1971 buys $0.13 worth of stuff today

That's not inflation. That's a heist in slow motion.

The people who understood this — the ones who saw what was coming — they didn't save harder. They did something completely different.

I'll tell you what they did tomorrow.

— J. Marque

P.S. This is all in Book 1, Chapter 5. If you haven't gotten there yet, tonight's the night.

## EMAIL 3 — Day 2

**Subject:** The $847/year lie your bank is telling you
**Preview text:** Your savings account is costing you money.

---

{first_name},

Yesterday I told you I'd explain what the wealthy do differently.

Here it is — and it's going to bother you.

Your bank pays you 0.45% interest on your savings. Sounds like free money, right?

Inflation runs at 3-8% per year.

Do the math: if you have $10,000 in savings, you earn $45 in interest. But inflation steals $300-$800 in purchasing power.

**You're paying your bank $255-$755 a year to hold your money.** And they're lending it out at 7-24% to other people.

The wealthy figured this out a long time ago. They don't save. They acquire. Real estate. Businesses. Assets that go UP when the dollar goes DOWN.

That's the entire game. And nobody teaches it because the system needs you to keep saving.

This is exactly what Book 2 — *Modern Money* — breaks down. How the Federal Reserve actually works. How banks create money from nothing. How inflation is a feature, not a bug.

And Book 3 shows you what's coming next — the biggest wealth transfer in history — and how to be on the right side of it.

All three books. 28,000 words. The full picture.

I'll tell you how to get them tomorrow.

## EMAIL 4 — Day 4

**Subject:** BlackRock just bet $4.7 billion on this
**Preview text:** When the biggest fund on earth moves, pay attention.

---

{first_name},

BlackRock — the world's largest asset manager — just put $4.7 billion into a single asset class.

Central banks are hoarding gold at record levels. Saudi Arabia is selling oil in yuan for the first time in 50 years. The U.S. national debt just passed $36 trillion.

Something is shifting. And the people at the top are repositioning.

Book 1 showed you how we got here.
Book 2 shows you how the system really works.
Book 3 shows you **what's coming next** — and gives you a 10-step playbook to get positioned before most people even realize the rules changed.

The full trilogy is $7. Less than your morning coffee.

28,000+ words of financial education. $250 million in real-world experience distilled into three books. No fluff. No theory. Just the truth about money — past, present, and future.

The people who read all three tell me the same thing: "I can't believe I didn't know this."

You already started. Finish the story.

— J. Marque

P.S. Book 3, Chapter 7 — the one about CBDCs and programmable money — that's the chapter that keeps people up at night. In a good way.

## EMAIL 5 — Day 5

**Subject:** "I read all 3 in one weekend" — Marcus, Atlanta
**Preview text:** His exact words after finishing Book 3.

---

{first_name},

I got this message last week from Marcus in Atlanta:

*"I downloaded Book 1 on Saturday morning. By Sunday night I'd read all three. I immediately moved money out of my savings account and started researching rental properties. I can't believe nobody taught me this stuff."*

Marcus isn't a finance guy. He's an electrician. Father of two. He just wanted to understand why he was working harder every year but falling further behind.

Three books later, he's not confused anymore. He's angry — but in a productive way. The kind of angry that makes you take action.

That's what the trilogy does. It takes you from "I don't know what I don't know" to "I see it now. And I know what to do."

28,000 words. Three books. $7.

Your grandparents could buy a house on one income. You can barely pay rent on two. The trilogy explains exactly why — and what to do about it.

— J. Marque

P.S. Marcus's next step? He's working through the FIRE workbook now. I'll tell you about that soon.

## EMAIL 6 — Day 7

**Subject:** Last chance at $7 — price going up
**Preview text:** This is my last email about this.

---

{first_name},

I've sent you a few emails this week about the Money Decoded trilogy.

This is the last one.

The $7 price was always meant to be temporary. I wanted to make it easy for people who downloaded Book 1 to get the complete picture without thinking twice.

After this week, the bundle goes to $19.99.

Here's what you're getting for $7:

- **Book 1:** The History of Money — how gold became paper became promises
- **Book 2:** Modern Money — how the Fed, banks, and inflation drain your wealth
- **Book 3:** The Future of Money — Bitcoin, CBDCs, gold, and your 10-step playbook

28,000 words. $250M in real-world experience. Three books that connect the dots most people never see.

[Get the trilogy for $7 before the price goes up →]

If $7 isn't the right move for you right now, no hard feelings. I'll keep sending you insights every week — no pitch, just value.

But if you want the complete picture, this is the time.

— J. Marque

P.S. Everyone who reads all three says the same thing: "Book 1 opened my eyes. Book 2 made me angry. Book 3 made me dangerous." Your call.
