**Subject:** Your Wealth Shift materials are ready
**Preview text:** You just made the smartest financial decision this year.

---

{first_name},

You chose the passive investor track. That tells me you're not looking for a side hustle -- you're looking for a strategy.

You have money. You know it should be working harder. And you're smart enough to know that the conventional advice -- max out your 401(k), diversify into index funds, wait 30 years -- isn't producing the results you were promised.

You're right. And The Wealth Shift is going to show you exactly why -- and what to do about it.

Your complete package is ready:

[Access The Wealth Shift →]

**PDF guide** -- 72 pages of strategy, not theory
**5 audio modules** -- 18 minutes each, designed for your commute or lunch break
**8 worksheets + calculators** -- including the Wealth Drain Calculator that most people call "the most eye-opening 5 minutes of my financial life"

**Start here:** Open the Wealth Drain Calculator (Worksheet 1) and input your current retirement account balances, management fees, and fund performance. Most people discover they're losing $3,000-$15,000 per year to fees and underperformance they didn't know existed.

Then listen to Audio Module 1 on your next commute. By the time you park, you'll see your portfolio differently.

Over the next few weeks, I'll share insights that go beyond the guide -- my personal experience repositioning capital, the case studies I didn't publish, and an opportunity I only offer to people who are serious about making this shift.

Welcome to the other side.

## EMAIL 2 — Day 2
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** What your financial advisor won't tell you
**Preview text:** They lose money when you learn this.

---

{first_name},

I need to tell you something your financial advisor will never say.

They don't want you to know about Self-Directed IRAs. Not because SDIRAs are bad. Because SDIRAs move your money OUT of the funds they manage -- and that's how they get paid.

Here's the math.

The average 401(k) charges 1-2% in annual management fees. On a $300K account, that's $3,000-$6,000 per year. Over 20 years, that's $60,000-$120,000 in fees alone -- before you account for underperformance.

Meanwhile, a self-directed IRA lets you invest that same retirement money directly into real estate -- rental properties, tax liens, private lending, syndications. Assets that produce 12-25% annual returns instead of the 6-8% your target-date fund averages.

David -- you'll meet him in a few days -- had $340K across two retirement accounts. He repositioned $80K into a self-directed IRA and used it to fund his first rental property. That single move now produces $730/month in cash flow. His 401(k) was producing $170/month in paper gains. Same money. Different vehicle. 4x the return.

Module 2 of your Wealth Shift guide walks through the entire SDIRA process. The Rollover Checklist has 21 steps, in order, so you don't miss anything.

But first -- have you run the Wealth Drain Calculator yet? If not, do it today. What you find might make you uncomfortable. That discomfort is productive.

-- J. Marque

P.S. I'm not anti-stock market. I'm anti-ignorance. If you're going to keep money in the market, do it because you've made an informed decision -- not because your advisor told you to.

## EMAIL 3 — Day 4
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** The $250M lesson most professionals miss
**Preview text:** I've watched smart people make this mistake for 15 years.

---

{first_name},

After $250 million in real estate transactions, I've worked with hundreds of high-earning professionals. Engineers. Attorneys. Physicians. Executives. People making $150K-$500K per year.

And I've watched most of them make the same mistake.

They're brilliant at earning. They're terrible at deploying.

They save aggressively. They max out their 401(k). They might have a Roth. Maybe some index funds. They do everything their financial advisor tells them.

And 20 years later, they have a portfolio that grew 7% annually, lost 1.5% to fees, lost 3-5% to inflation, and netted them a real return of... maybe 1-2%.

Meanwhile, I've watched people with half their income build twice their wealth. Not because they earned more. Because they deployed differently.

**The wealthy don't save. They acquire.**

Real estate. Businesses. Assets that cash flow. Assets that appreciate. Assets that provide tax advantages. Assets where you control the outcome -- not some fund manager in New York.

That's not theory. That's what Module 3 of The Wealth Shift is about: running the math backwards from your target monthly income to the exact number of units, price points, and returns you need to replace your W-2.

The Cash Flow Replacement Calculator makes this tangible. Input your monthly expenses, and it shows you exactly what your portfolio needs to look like.

I did this for myself at age 30. The number was smaller than I expected. And that's when everything changed.

## EMAIL 4 — Day 7
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** {first_name}, this is David's story
**Preview text:** From $340K in retirement accounts earning 6% to $2,400/mo cash flow.

---

{first_name},

David is an engineer. Makes $95K. Has a wife and two kids. Good life by most measures.

But 14 months ago, David had a problem he couldn't solve with engineering.

He had $340K across two retirement accounts. One 401(k) from his current employer. One IRA from a previous job. Both in target-date funds. Both earning 6-8% in good years, losing 10-15% in bad ones. Both charging fees he'd never bothered to calculate.

He read Money Decoded. Then he ran the Wealth Drain Calculator from The Wealth Shift.

What he found: his two accounts were losing a combined $7,400/year to management fees and inflation drag. In 20 years, at that rate, he'd lose $148,000 to the system. Not including the opportunity cost of what that money could have produced elsewhere.

Here's what David did:

He repositioned $80K from his old 401(k) into a self-directed IRA. No penalty. No taxes (it was a direct rollover). The process took about 3 weeks using the 21-step checklist.

Then he used that SDIRA to fund his first BRRRR deal:
- Purchased a distressed property for $140K
- Invested $35K in renovation
- Property appraised at $225K
- Refinanced, pulled most of his capital back out
- Monthly rent: $1,850. Monthly expenses: $1,120. Cash flow: $730/month.

David repeated the process. 12 months in, he has 4 doors producing $6,800/month in gross rent and $2,400/month in net cash flow.

His remaining retirement accounts? He repositioned another $60K. He still has market exposure -- he's not anti-stock. But now his money is working in TWO lanes instead of one.

David didn't quit his job. He doesn't want to. He likes engineering. But now he has options. And options change everything.

**The Wealth Shift showed him where his money was going. The coaching showed him where to put it.**

More on the coaching soon.

-- J. Marque

P.S. David says the hardest part was the first phone call to the SDIRA custodian. "After that, I wondered why I'd waited so long." Module 2 of your guide has the exact script for that call.

## EMAIL 5 — Day 9
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** The fear that keeps $500K locked in a 401(k)
**Preview text:** It's not the market. It's what nobody talks about.

---

{first_name},

I've watched smart, successful professionals leave $200K-$500K sitting in retirement accounts earning 6% when they know -- intellectually -- that real estate returns 15-25%.

Why don't they move it?

Fear. But not the fear you'd expect.

It's not fear of losing money. High earners understand risk. It's fear of **making a mistake with a large sum.** Because when you're moving $100K-$300K, one wrong decision feels catastrophic. So instead of making a move, they make no move. And no move IS a move -- it's a decision to keep losing to fees, inflation, and opportunity cost.

Here's what I've learned after $250 million in transactions:

**The risk of doing nothing is always greater than the risk of doing something with guidance.**

The key words: "with guidance."

I would never tell someone to reposition $200K into real estate by watching YouTube videos. That's irresponsible. What I would tell them -- what I DO tell them -- is to do it with someone who's executed this move hundreds of times, who knows the custodians, the deal structures, the tax implications, and the markets.

That's the difference between David (who repositioned $140K and now has $2,400/month in cash flow) and the people who read about SDIRAs three years ago and still haven't made the call.

Module 4 of The Wealth Shift covers due diligence for the busy professional -- the 7 metrics that matter, the "30-Minute Deal Review" framework, and how to evaluate opportunities without becoming a full-time real estate investor.

But the real unlock isn't in the guide. It's in having someone review YOUR specific numbers. YOUR specific accounts. YOUR specific market.

I'll share how to make that happen in my next email.

## EMAIL 6 — Day 11
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** 3 wealth mistakes smart professionals make
**Preview text:** Your intelligence is costing you money.

---

{first_name},

The smarter you are, the more likely you are to make these mistakes. That sounds counterintuitive. It isn't.

**Mistake 1: Over-diversifying into mediocrity.**
You have a 401(k), a Roth, some index funds, maybe an HSA, maybe some individual stocks. You're "diversified." But diversification before concentration is just spreading weakness thin. The wealthiest people I've worked with got rich by going deep in ONE asset class first. Real estate. Then they diversified. Your portfolio might look sophisticated on paper. But if everything is earning 6-8% and losing 1-2% to fees, you have a lot of accounts doing the same mediocre thing.

**Mistake 2: Trusting the wrong people with large sums.**
Your financial advisor works for a firm. The firm gets paid when your money stays in their funds. That's not a conspiracy -- it's a business model. The question isn't whether your advisor is a good person. It's whether their incentives align with yours. If they've never mentioned SDIRAs, 1031 exchanges, or cost segregation studies, that tells you everything.

**Mistake 3: Confusing income with wealth.**
You earn well. Maybe very well. But income and wealth are not the same thing. Income is what you earn. Wealth is what you keep and deploy. I've met $400K/year earners with a negative net worth and $60K/year earners with $500K in rental equity. The difference is deployment, not salary.

The Wealth Shift addresses all three mistakes. But the guide can only take you so far.

The people who actually make the shift -- who reposition six figures from underperforming accounts into cash-flowing real estate -- they do it with someone who's done it before.

That's what I'm going to tell you about next.

## EMAIL 7 — Day 13
**Template: 3 (Dark Premium)**

**Subject:** Applications open -- your personal wealth strategist
**Preview text:** 6 months. Your money. A $250M advisor in your corner.

---

{first_name},

You've had The Wealth Shift for almost two weeks. You've seen the math. You've heard David's story. You know what's possible.

The question is: do you want to reposition your wealth alone, or with someone who's done $250M in transactions guiding every step?

**I'm opening applications for the next coaching cohort.**

This isn't a course. It's not a community of beginners sharing memes. This is a 6-month strategic advisory with direct access to me.

Here's what you get:

**2 live group calls per week**
Tuesday: Strategy session (market analysis, portfolio review, repositioning updates)
Thursday: Hot seat (bring YOUR situation -- your numbers, your accounts, your questions -- and we solve it live)

**Personal portfolio review**
I look at your specific retirement accounts, your income, your goals, and your risk tolerance. We build a repositioning plan tailored to you. Not a template. A plan.

**Complete deal review service**
Every deal you consider -- I run every exit strategy. Rental, BRRRR, syndication participation, private lending. You'll know exactly what to expect before you commit a dollar.

**SDIRA + repositioning support**
Custodian selection. Rollover execution. Tax implications. Timing strategy. You're not figuring this out from a 21-step checklist alone. You have someone who's guided hundreds of repositions walking you through yours.

**Private community of serious investors**
Not beginners. Other professionals making this same shift. Attorneys, engineers, physicians, executives -- people who think about money the way you do.

**The investment: $5,997**

Let me put that in context.

David's Wealth Drain Calculator showed he was losing $7,400/year to fees and underperformance. Over 10 years, that's $74,000. The program costs less than what most high earners lose in a single year to the system they're currently in.

His first BRRRR property now produces $8,760/year in cash flow. The program paid for itself in 8 months.

Financing available -- 12-60 month plans. Your monthly payment could be less than the management fees you're already paying.

15 spots per cohort. When they're full, the next cohort opens in 3 months.

[Apply for the Coaching Program →]

This is for you if:
- You have $50K+ in retirement accounts or liquid capital ready to deploy
- You're serious about repositioning into real estate (not just curious)
- You want a strategic advisor, not a YouTube guru
- You can commit to 2 calls per week for 6 months

If that's you, apply. It takes 3 minutes.

-- J. Marque

P.S. Everyone who applies gets a complimentary strategy call. On the call, I'll review your current portfolio position and outline a 6-month repositioning plan -- yours to keep whether you join the program or not. No pressure. Just strategy.

## EMAIL 8 — Day 15
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** 8 spots remaining -- your questions answered
**Preview text:** What every high earner asks before joining.

---

{first_name},

7 spots filled in 3 days. 8 remain.

Here are the questions I hear from professionals like you:

**"$5,997 is significant. How do I justify this?"**
Run the numbers. What are you losing per year to management fees, inflation drag, and underperformance? For most people with $200K+ in retirement accounts, it's $4,000-$12,000 annually. The program costs less than one year of losses you're currently absorbing. David's first repositioned property produces $8,760/year. The ROI isn't theoretical -- it's measurable.

**"I don't want to become a full-time landlord."**
Neither did David. Neither do most people in this program. That's why Module 4 of The Wealth Shift covers the "Busy Professional" model -- property management, remote evaluation, and passive ownership structures. Your involvement post-setup: 2-3 hours per month.

**"I already have a financial advisor."**
Good. Keep them. But ask yourself: have they ever mentioned SDIRAs? Have they modeled what your retirement accounts would produce in real estate? Have they compared your all-in cost (fees + taxes + inflation) against alternative deployment? If not, their blind spots are costing you money. This program fills those gaps.

**"What if the real estate market drops?"**
Markets cycle. That's the point. When you're buying cash-flowing rental properties at the right basis, a market correction doesn't destroy you -- it creates opportunities. David bought in a "bad" market. His properties cash flow regardless of what Zillow says they're worth because his purchase price and renovation cost gave him margin.

[Apply Now -- 8 Spots Remaining →]

When this cohort fills, the next one is 3 months out. The fees you're paying and the returns you're missing don't pause while you wait.

-- J. Marque

P.S. The strategy call is complimentary. 30 minutes. I review your portfolio position, identify your biggest repositioning opportunity, and give you a 6-month roadmap. No sales pitch -- just numbers.

---

## EMAIL 9 — Day 18
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** final note on the program
**Preview text:** This is my last email about coaching.

---

{first_name},

This is my last email about the coaching program until the next cohort.

Where we stand:
- 15 spots. 11 filled. 4 remaining.
- Applications close Friday.

I want to be straight with you.

You're a professional. You earn well. You're smart. You read Money Decoded because you wanted the truth about money. You chose the passive investor track because you know your money should be working harder. You purchased The Wealth Shift because you're serious.

That tells me something about you.

The question isn't whether you believe in this strategy. You've seen the math. You've seen David's results. You know the Wealth Drain Calculator doesn't lie.

The question is whether this is the right time.

If it is:

[Apply Before Friday →]

If it isn't -- I respect that completely. There's no penalty for waiting. The next cohort opens in 3 months. I'll continue sending you wealth strategy insights every week -- no pitch, just analysis.

But I'll leave you with one number.

Every month you don't reposition is a month your current portfolio continues to underperform. For someone with $300K in traditional retirement accounts, that's roughly $500-$1,000/month in lost returns compared to what that money could produce in real estate. In 3 months, that's $1,500-$3,000. In a year, $6,000-$12,000.

The cost of inaction always exceeds the cost of action. That's the most expensive lesson I've learned in $250 million worth of transactions.

Whatever you decide, I'm in your corner.

-- J. Marque

P.S. Reply "later" and I'll personally notify you when the next cohort opens. No automated email. Me.
