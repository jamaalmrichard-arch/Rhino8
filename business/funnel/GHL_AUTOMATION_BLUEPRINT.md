---

### Step 2: Delivery + Tripwire Page

**Step Name:** `Delivery-Tripwire`
**Step URL:** `/book-download`
**Purpose:** Deliver Book 1 + sell $7 Trilogy

**Page Elements (top to bottom):**

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Confirmation Banner** | "Your free ebook is on its way to your inbox. Start reading below." |
| **Embedded Book 1** | Either iframe reader or "Download Book 1 Now" button linking to PDF |
| **Divider / Transition** | "You've seen Chapter 1. Here's the full story." |
| **Trilogy Offer Section** | Headline: "Get the Complete Trilogy for Just $7" |
| **Three Book Covers** | Side by side: Book 1, Book 2, Book 3 |
| **Bullet Points** | What's in each book (use 3-line descriptions from sales-copy.md) |

   - Step 2: Card Number, Expiration, CVC

5. **Submit Button:** Text: "GET THE TRILOGY — $7" / Color: Gold on Black
6. **On Submit:** Redirect to Step 3 (Questionnaire page)

---

### Step 3: Post-Purchase Questionnaire Page

**Step Name:** `Track-Selection`
**Step URL:** `/your-path`
**Purpose:** Route $7 buyers into 1 of 3 tracks based on self-selection. Replaces the old OTO page.

**Page Elements (top to bottom):**

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Confirmation Header** | "Smart move — your trilogy is confirmed! Check your email for download links." |
| **Transition** | "One quick question before we send your books..." |
| **Subheadline** | "This helps me personalize what I send you next." |
| **Card 1 — Active Investor** | "I want to make money in real estate" / "Teach me how to find deals, close deals, and build cash flow — even in a down market." |
| **Card 2 — Passive Investor** | "I have money that should be working harder" / "Show me how to move my retirement, savings, or investments into real estate — without quitting my job." |
| **Card 3 — The Foundation** | "I'm starting from scratch" / "I need to understand my finances and get investor-ready before my first deal." |
| **Default nudge** | "Not sure? Start with The Foundation — it's where every great investor begins." |

**Implementation — GHL Form with Conditional Redirect:**

1. Create a **Form** element on the page (NOT a survey — we want a fast single-click experience)
2. Add a **Radio Button** or **Custom HTML** field named `investor_track` with 3 options:
   - `active` → "I want to make money in real estate"
   - `passive` → "I have money that should be working harder"
   - `foundation` → "I'm starting from scratch"
3. Style as large clickable cards (use GHL custom CSS or custom HTML element)
4. **On Submit:** Trigger workflow `MD — Questionnaire Router` (Section 4)
5. Redirect logic is handled BY THE WORKFLOW, which updates a custom field and uses conditional redirects:
   - If `investor_track` = `active` → redirect to Step 4A (Deal Machine offer page)
   - If `investor_track` = `passive` → redirect to Step 4B (Wealth Shift offer page)
   - If `investor_track` = `foundation` → redirect to Step 4C (Foundation offer page)

**Alternative implementation:** Use 3 separate buttons, each linked to a different GHL form that applies the correct tag and redirects to the correct page. This avoids conditional redirect complexity.

**Three-Button Approach (simpler):**
- Button 1: Links to `/deal-machine-offer` — form auto-applies `track-active` tag
- Button 2: Links to `/wealth-shift-offer` — form auto-applies `track-passive` tag
- Button 3: Links to `/foundation-offer` — form auto-applies `track-foundation` tag
- Each button URL appends the contact's email as a query parameter: `?email={{contact.email}}`

### WORKFLOW: Trilogy Purchase Handler

**Workflow Name:** `MD — Trilogy Purchase Handler`
**Trigger Type:** Payment Received (Stripe) / Order Submitted
**Trigger Filter:** Product = `Money Decoded Trilogy — All 3 Books`

This is a SEPARATE workflow from Sequence A. It handles what happens when someone buys the $7 trilogy — regardless of whether they came from Sequence A emails or directly from the funnel page.

```
TRIGGER: Order Submitted → Product = "Money Decoded Trilogy"
  │
  ├─ Step 1: ADD TAG → "buyer"
  │
  ├─ Step 2: ADD TAG → "trilogy-purchased"
  │
  ├─ Step 3: REMOVE TAG → "in-sequence-a"
  │    (Removes them from Sequence A if they were in it)
  │
  ├─ Step 4: REMOVE FROM WORKFLOW → "MD — Sequence A: Book 1 to Trilogy"
  │    (Stops Sequence A emails)
  │
  ├─ Step 5: UPDATE PIPELINE STAGE
  │    Pipeline: "Money Decoded Funnel"
  │    Stage: "Trilogy Buyer"
  │
  ├─ Step 6: GRANT MEMBERSHIP ACCESS
  │    Membership: "Money Decoded"
  │    Level: "Trilogy"
  │
  ├─ Step 7: SEND EMAIL → "Trilogy Purchase Confirmation"
  │    Subject: Smart move — your trilogy is ready
  │    Body: Download links for all 3 books + membership portal login
  │    NOTE: Do NOT include track product pitch here. The questionnaire page handles routing.
  │
  └─ END
```

**Note:** After the $7 purchase, the buyer is redirected to the Questionnaire page (Step 3 of the funnel). The Questionnaire Router workflow handles track selection and downstream routing. This handler only deals with purchase confirmation and delivery.

---

### WORKFLOW: Questionnaire Router

**Workflow Name:** `MD — Questionnaire Router`
**Trigger Type:** Form Submitted
**Trigger Filter:** Form = `Track Selection Questionnaire`

This workflow fires when the buyer selects their track on the post-purchase questionnaire page. It applies the track tag, updates the pipeline, and sets the redirect.

```
TRIGGER: Form Submitted → "Track Selection Questionnaire"
  │
  ├─ Step 1: UPDATE PIPELINE STAGE
  │    Pipeline: "Money Decoded Funnel"
  │    Stage: "Track Selected"
  │
  ├─ Step 2: IF/ELSE → Custom field "investor_track" = "active"?
  │    ├─ YES →
  │    │    ├─ ADD TAG → "track-active"
  │    │    ├─ REDIRECT → /deal-machine-offer
  │    │    └─ WAIT → 1 hour
  │    │         └─ IF/ELSE → Contact has tag "deal-machine-buyer"?
  │    │              ├─ YES → END (C1 triggered by purchase handler)
  │    │              └─ NO → ENROLL IN WORKFLOW → "MD — Sequence B1: Push Deal Machine"
  │    │
  │    └─ NO → Continue
  │
  ├─ Step 3: IF/ELSE → Custom field "investor_track" = "passive"?
  │    ├─ YES →
  │    │    ├─ ADD TAG → "track-passive"
  │    │    ├─ REDIRECT → /wealth-shift-offer
  │    │    └─ WAIT → 1 hour
  │    │         └─ IF/ELSE → Contact has tag "wealth-shift-buyer"?
  │    │              ├─ YES → END (C2 triggered by purchase handler)
  │    │              └─ NO → ENROLL IN WORKFLOW → "MD — Sequence B2: Push Wealth Shift"
  │    │
  │    └─ NO → Continue
  │
  ├─ Step 4: IF/ELSE → Custom field "investor_track" = "foundation"?
  │    ├─ YES →
  │    │    ├─ ADD TAG → "track-foundation"
  │    │    ├─ REDIRECT → /foundation-offer
  │    │    └─ WAIT → 1 hour
  │    │         └─ IF/ELSE → Contact has tag "foundation-buyer"?
  │    │              ├─ YES → END (C3 triggered by purchase handler)
  │    │              └─ NO → ENROLL IN WORKFLOW → "MD — Sequence B3: Push Foundation"
  │    │
  │    └─ NO → (fallback: treat as foundation)
  │         ├─ ADD TAG → "track-foundation"
  │         ├─ REDIRECT → /foundation-offer
  │         └─ WAIT → 1 hour
  │              └─ IF/ELSE → Contact has tag "foundation-buyer"?
  │                   ├─ YES → END
  │                   └─ NO → ENROLL IN WORKFLOW → "MD — Sequence B3: Push Foundation"
  │
  └─ END
```

**Key logic — the 1-hour wait:** After the buyer is redirected to their track offer page, we wait 1 hour to give them time to purchase. If they buy, the respective Purchase Handler workflow fires, applies the buyer tag, and enrolls them in the correct C sequence. If they do NOT buy within 1 hour, the Router enrolls them in the correct B sequence to nurture the sale via email.

## 8. REPORTING & KPIs

### Funnel Metrics Dashboard

Build the following tracking views in GHL. Use **Reporting > Dashboard** and **CRM > Smart Lists**.

#### Core Conversion Metrics

| Metric | How to Track in GHL | Target | Formula |
|--------|--------------------|---------|---------|
| **Opt-in Rate** | Funnel analytics: Step 1 views vs. form submissions | 25-40% | Submissions / Page Views |
| **$7 Conversion Rate** | Funnel analytics: Step 2 order form completions / total leads | 8-15% | Trilogy purchases / Total leads |
| **Questionnaire Completion Rate** | Track tag counts (any track tag) / trilogy buyers | 85% | Tracked contacts / Trilogy buyers |
| **Track Distribution** | Count of each track tag | 35% Active / 25% Passive / 40% Foundation | Per-tag count / Total tracked |
| **Track 1 Purchase Rate (page)** | Deal Machine purchases within 1 hour of track selection / track-active contacts | 25% | Immediate purchases / Track-active total |
| **Track 2 Purchase Rate (page)** | Wealth Shift purchases within 1 hour / track-passive contacts | 20% | Immediate purchases / Track-passive total |
| **Track 3 Purchase Rate (page)** | Foundation purchases within 1 hour / track-foundation contacts | 30% | Immediate purchases / Track-foundation total |
| **Track Product Purchase Rate (email B sequences)** | B1/B2/B3 email purchases / B1/B2/B3 enrollees | 8-12% | Email conversions / Non-buyer enrollees |
| **Application Rate** | Coaching applications / total track product buyers | 8-12% | Applicants / All track buyers |
| **Call Booking Rate** | Strategy calls booked / Applications | 70-80% | Booked / Applied |
| **Show Rate** | Calls completed / Calls booked | 75-85% | Showed / Booked |
| **Close Rate** | Enrollments / Calls completed | 30-40% | Enrolled / Calls completed |

#### Revenue Metrics

| Metric | How to Track | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Revenue per Lead** | Total revenue / Total opt-ins | $7.65+ (per 10K model) |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | Total checkout revenue / Total orders | $18-$30 (with track products) |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** | Total revenue per customer across all products | $50-$6,200 depending on journey |
| **Cost per Acquisition (CPA)** | Ad spend / Buyers (when running paid traffic) | Target: < $3 per $7 buyer |
| **Monthly Recurring Revenue** | Coaching payment plans + active subscriptions | Track in Payments > Subscriptions |
| **Total Funnel Revenue** | Sum of all product sales | Track in Payments > Transactions |

#### Revenue Model (per 10,000 leads)

| Stage | Volume | Revenue |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Opt-ins | 10,000 | $0 |
| $7 Trilogy (10% conversion) | 1,000 | $7,000 |
| Questionnaire completion (85%) | 850 | $0 |
| Track distribution | 298 Active / 213 Passive / 340 Foundation | $0 |
| **Track 1: Deal Machine ($147)** | | |
| - Immediate purchase (25% of 298) | 75 | $11,025 |
| - B1 email purchase (8% of remaining 223) | 18 | $2,646 |
| **Track 2: Wealth Shift ($197)** | | |
| - Immediate purchase (20% of 213) | 43 | $8,471 |
| - B2 email purchase (8% of remaining 170) | 14 | $2,758 |
| **Track 3: Foundation ($97)** | | |
| - Immediate purchase (30% of 340) | 102 | $9,894 |
| - B3 email purchase (8% of remaining 238) | 19 | $1,843 |
| **Total mid-tier buyers** | **271** | **$36,637** |
| Coaching applications (10% of 271) | 27 | $0 |
| Strategy calls booked (75% of 27) | 20 | $0 |
| Group enrollments (40% close rate) | 8 | $47,976 |

| **TOTAL REVENUE** | | **$106,610** |
| **Revenue per Lead** | | **$10.66** |

**Note on revenue improvement over old model:** The 3-track model projects $106,610 per 10K leads vs. the old single-OTO model's $83,587. The increase comes from:
- Higher track product conversion rates due to personalized offers (18-30% vs. 20% flat OTO)

- Higher coaching application rates from tailored C sequences (10% vs. 10%)
- Higher coaching close rates from better-informed strategy calls (40% vs. 30%)

## NOTES

- **Stripe Test Mode:** Use Stripe test mode for all testing. Card number `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry, any CVC. Switch to live mode only after full flow is verified.
- **Email From Address:** Set up a custom sending domain in GHL (Settings > Email Services) for better deliverability. Use `jmarque@yourdomain.com` or `hello@moneydecoded.com`.
- **SPF/DKIM/DMARC:** Configure DNS records for your sending domain to avoid spam folders. GHL provides the records under Settings > Email Services.
- **Webhook Backup:** If GHL's native Stripe integration misses an event, set up a Stripe webhook pointing to your GHL sub-account webhook URL as a failsafe.
- **GDPR/CAN-SPAM:** Include unsubscribe link in all emails (GHL adds this automatically). Include physical mailing address in email footer (use virtual office address from Northwest Registered Agent).
- **Mobile Testing:** Test every funnel page on mobile before going live. GHL funnels auto-generate mobile versions, but review and adjust spacing, font sizes, and button sizes.
- **Progressive Reveal:** Remember the identity reveal strategy. Stage 1 (books) = text only. Stage 2 (track products) = real voice via audio modules. Stage 3 (strategy call) = face reveal on video. This is intentional — do not add video or face imagery to earlier funnel stages.
- **Launch Strategy:** Can launch with Track 3 (Foundation) first since the FIRE Workbook already exists and just needs rebranding + audio. Route all questionnaire clicks to Foundation temporarily while building Track 1 and Track 2 products.
- **A/B Testing Priority:** Once live, test in this order: (1) opt-in page headline, (2) Email 4 subject line in Sequence A (first $7 pitch), (3) questionnaire card copy and order, (4) track offer page headlines, (5) C-sequence coaching pitch emails (7-9).
