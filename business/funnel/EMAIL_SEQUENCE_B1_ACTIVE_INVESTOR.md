## EMAIL 1 — Day 0 (Immediate after questionnaire selection)
**Template: 1 (Premium Branded)**

**Subject:** You picked the active track -- your books are ready
**Preview text:** Trilogy download inside. Plus what's next for deal-makers.

{first_name},

You bought the trilogy. And then you picked the active investor track.

That tells me you're not reading these books for fun. You want to make money in real estate. You want to find deals, close them, and build something that pays you every month.

Good. You're in the right place.

Here's your download link for all three Money Decoded books:

[Download Your Trilogy -->]

**Book 1** -- how money was designed to work against you.
**Book 2** -- the modern system that drains wealth silently.
**Book 3** -- what the people who actually build wealth do differently.

Read them in order. Each one builds on the last.

Start with Book 1 this week. By the time you finish Book 3, you'll understand money better than 99% of people walking around right now. And you'll be ready for the next step.

Because understanding money and making money are two completely different things.

I'll show you what I mean in a couple days.

## EMAIL 2 — Day 2
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** The gap nobody talks about
**Preview text:** Knowing how money works won't make you rich.

---

{first_name},

You're a couple days into the trilogy now. Maybe you've finished Book 1, maybe you're into Book 2.

Either way, you know things most people never will. How fractional reserve banking actually works. Why savers lose. What inflation really does to your purchasing power over 20 years.

That knowledge matters. But I'm going to be straight with you.

After $250 million in real estate transactions, I've watched hundreds of smart, well-read people stay broke. They could explain money. They could debate the Federal Reserve at a dinner party. They knew more about the financial system than most financial advisors.

And they never made a dime from any of it.

The gap between understanding money and making money in real estate is one thing: **a system.**

Not motivation. Not more books. Not a YouTube playlist. A system that tells you what to do on Monday morning. How to find a seller. What to say on the phone. How to analyze a deal in 10 minutes. How to close your first wholesale check for $5K-$15K without using a dollar of your own money.

That's what I built. I call it The Deal Machine.

It's 6 modules, 12 ready-to-use templates, 3 deal analysis spreadsheets, and audio modules where you hear my actual voice for the first time walking you through each strategy.

Wholesaling. BRRRR. Flipping. Creative finance. Sub-to deals. Seller financing. And a 90-day execution roadmap that takes you from "I get it" to "I closed my first deal."

I'll break it all down for you next time.

## EMAIL 3 — Day 4
**Template: 4 (Pure Text)**

**Subject:** 6 modules, 12 templates, your first deal
**Preview text:** What's inside The Deal Machine -- and why Module 2 alone is worth $5K.

---

{first_name},

Let me walk you through exactly what's inside The Deal Machine.

**Module 1: The Down Market Advantage.** Why this market, right now, with high rates and scared competition, is where real investors get rich. The "Fear Index" framework that tells you when to move aggressively.

**Module 2: Wholesaling -- Your First $5K-$15K.** The fastest path to cash in real estate. Zero dollars needed. Zero credit needed. I break down skip tracing, driving for dollars, and the 13-Touch Follow-Up System that's generated hundreds of thousands in assignment fees. Three real wholesale deals walked through with actual numbers. This module alone can pay for the product 30x over on a single deal.

**Module 3: The BRRRR Method.** Buy, rehab, rent, refinance, repeat. How to acquire rental properties with almost no money left in the deal when you're done.

**Module 4: Fix & Flip.** The 70% rule, ARV analysis, scope of work creation, and the 5 renovation decisions that make or break your profit. Includes the Flip Profit Calculator.

**Module 5: Creative Finance.** Sub-to, seller financing, lease options, wraps. The exact language to use with sellers. Four fill-in-the-blank term sheets.

**Module 6: Your 90-Day Execution Roadmap.** Day by day. Week by week. When to make your first 50 seller calls. When to submit your first offer. When to close your first deal. Plus the 90-Day Accountability Tracker.

And every module has an audio version. That's the first time you'll hear my voice. Not an AI avatar. Me. Recorded for your commute, your lunch break, or 6AM before the house wakes up.

The templates? 12 of them. The 13-Touch Script Pack. Wholesale deal analyzer. BRRRR calculator. Contractor vetting checklist. Pipeline tracker. Fill in the blanks and go.

$147.

David used this system. 12 months later: 4 properties, $6,800/month in gross rent, $2,400/month in net cash flow. Keisha used it. Her first wholesale check was $8,500. She cried. It was 2 months of teacher salary.

The trilogy told you how money works. This tells you how to make it.

## EMAIL 4 — Day 7
**Template: 2 (Clean Minimal)**

**Subject:** {first_name}, one more thing
**Preview text:** $147 vs your first deal. Let me do the math.

---

{first_name},

I'll keep this short.

You chose the active investor track because you want to close deals. Not watch videos about deals. Not think about deals someday. Close them.

A few things people ask me before pulling the trigger:

**"$147 is a lot for a digital product."**
Is it? Keisha's first wholesale deal paid $8,500. David's first BRRRR property cash flows $730/month, which is $8,760/year. The 13-Touch Script Pack alone has produced hundreds of thousands in assignment fees for people using it. One deal covers the cost 50x over. It's not $147. It's the price of the tool that brings your first $5K-$15K check.

**"I'm not ready."**
Module 6 is literally a day-by-day plan for your first 90 days. It starts from zero. If you can make a phone call and follow a template, you're ready.

**"Can I do this without money or credit?"**
Wholesaling requires neither. That's Module 2. Find a motivated seller, put the property under contract, assign it to another investor, collect the fee. Keisha did it with $0 to her name.

The trilogy gave you the map. The Deal Machine is the GPS. It tells you where to turn, when to stop, and when to hit the gas.

[Get The Deal Machine -- $147 -->]

If the timing isn't right, I respect that. I'll keep sending you value every week. No pitch. Just real estate insights and market analysis.

But if you're serious about closing your first deal, this is the bridge between knowing and doing.

Let's go make some money.

-- J. Marque

P.S. Everyone who buys The Deal Machine says the same thing: the 13-Touch Script Pack and the wholesaling module are worth 10x the price alone. That system closes deals on touch 9 while everyone else quits after touch 3.
